Dice Rolls
----------

Dice rolls use a D6.
If the dice rolls a natural 1, roll again: a 1 or 2 means GM Intrusion.
If the dice rolls a antural 6, roll again: a 5 or 6 means Player Intrusion.

`Mundane Ability + Effort + circumstantial bonuses + Special Ability modifiers + D6 >= Difficulty + circumstantial maluses`

Mundane Abilities add 1 for Trained, 2 for Specialized, 3 for Defining (see below).

Every level of Effort used costs 2.
If either your Body Pool or your Mind Pool is at 0, every level of Effort costs 3 (Player Intrusions are not affected).


Body, Mind, Essence
-------------------
Characters have three pools: Body, Mind and (for those who can use it) Essence.

Body and Mind can have Edges.

Essence cannot have Edges, but regenerates at a rate of Tier points per combat turn.

Whenever the character would deliberately spend points from their Body or Mind Pool, they can use their Essence Pool instead: in this case, the whole cost must be paid in Essence and Edges do not apply.

Some special abilities can be fuelled exclusively with Essence.

If Body is at zero, you lose one point from Mind every turn.

Stunts
------
The more interesting and awesome the action you describe, the higher the stunt.

A **Stunt 1** is when you do a cool description of your PC Action.
  * You recover 1 point to any of your Pools

A **Stunt 2** is when you exploit some part of the environment or the context that otherwise would not factor in your action.
  * You recover 2 points to any of your Pools
  * You get a Destiny Point

A **Stunt 3** is when the whole table looks at you in disbelief and erupts in yell or laughter.
  * You recover 3 points to any of your Pools
  * You get a Destiny Point
  * You get an Experience Point


Destiny Points
--------------
You get Destiny Points by stunting (Stunt 2 or Stunt 3).

You can spend them at any time to:
  * Reroll (you can use it also to allow another player to reroll)
  * Flashback
  * Player Intrusion
  * Refuse GM Intrusions


Experience Points
-----------------
You get XPs:
  * When you discover something
  * When you do a Stunt 3
  * When you accept a GM Intrusion
  * When someone else accepts a GM Intrusion and gives their second XP to you


Defining Ability
----------------
By spending 8 XPs, a PC can upgrade a Mundane Ability from Specialized to Defining.
This does *not* count towards any Upgrade.
A character can have no more than *ONE* Defining Ability and the Defining Ability must be consistent with their Focus.


Evocations
----------
Unlocking an Artefact Evocation costs 2 XPs.


Cyphers
-------
In general, a Cypher is not a supernatural effect, but just the character being really, really good at what she does.

When a player uses a Cypher, only the mechanical description is important, and the player must justify and describe the effect in a way that fits her character.

This description can take the form of special equipment (for example, to justify a ranged attack, the player could have her character extract a concealed knife from somewhere and throw it), special skill (for example, a special martial art style move, which should definitely have a name!) some item specifically prepared for a specific contingency (“I did suspect the blade was coated in venom, so I brought an anti-venom….”) or some other special skill or insight or knowledge.

Every time a character takes a Recovery Action, they get one new Cypher.

If this goes above their limit, they discard any excess Cypher.


Combat
------

The excess successes of an Attack Roll are added to the attack's damage.

### Armor
Wearing armor reduces Body by a given value when worn.
  - Using armor requires being Trained in Combat
  - Mundane light armor: soak 1, -3 Body
  - Mundane heavy armor: soak 2, -6 Body


### Disarm
Without special Abilities that explicitly allow you to disarm a foe, disarming requires an Intrusion.


### Clinch
Clinch is an attack Action with a -1 penalty that inflicts no damage.

If the clinch is successful, the two characters become Controller and Victim.

Controller and Victim characters can only attack each other.

The Controller can break the Clinch at any moment.

The Victim takes a -2 penalty to everything, including defense rolls, and can't go anywhere.

If the Controller attacks the Victim successfully, they can inflict damage as normal.

If the Victim attacks the Controller successfully, they can break free of the clinch; with an Intrusion the Victim can swap role with the Controller.


### Unexpected Attacks
When defending against an Unexpected attack:
* A character with Pools can spend points only up to their Edge.
* A character without Pools has their Level halved.



Extended Action
---------------

An Extended Action is used when it's important to know how long a task will take, and has the following features:
  * An **Interval** - This is how often you get to Roll (1 hour, 1 action, 1 day...)
  * A **Difficulty** - You need to roll higher than this to make any progress at all.
  * A **Goal Number** - This is how many successes above the Difficulty you need to accumulate to succeed in the task.
  * A **Terminus** - This is how many rolls you can do before the task fails.

If the Player fails to reach the Goal Number after (Terminus) rolls, they failed and will have to tackle the problem from a different angle.


Project
-------

A Project is an Extended Action to create or modify something: it could be a Sorcerous Working, the crafting of an Artefact, a bureaucratic reform, a book...

Many Projects will require the Player to spend XPs on them.

In a Project:
  * The Difficulty reflects how much control the Player has on how the results look like.
  * The Goal Number reflects how ambitious the Project is.
  * The Terminus reflects the resources available to the Player.

For the minimum Difficulty, the Player is guaranteed that its base intention will be fulfilled, but all the details will be in the hands of the GM.

The Player can decide to increase the Difficulty by 2: in this case the Player can give give a rough description of how the final result will look like and the GM will embellish with catches, quirks and twist that make the result more interesting without undermining its core intent.

If instead the Player wants full control on the outcome, defining exactly how the result will look like, they can increase the Difficulty by 4.

A Project does not absorb 100% of the character's time, but does require them to be available to work on it every day.
