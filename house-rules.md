BODY, MIND, ESSENCE
===================
Characters have three pools: Body, Mind and (for those who can use it) Essence.

Body and Mind can have Edges.

Essence cannot have Edges, but regenerates at a rate of Tier points per combat turn.

Whenever the character would deliberately spend points from their Body or Mind Pool, they can use their Essence Pool instead: in this case, the whole cost must be paid in Essence and Edges do not apply.

Some special abilities can be fuelled exclusively with Essence.


EFFORT
======
Every level of Effort used costs 2.


STUNTS
======
The more interesting and awesome the action you describe, the higher the stunt.

Stunt 1
-------
A Stunt 1 is when you do a cool description of your PC Action.
  * You recover 1 point to any of your Pools

Stunt 2
-------
A Stunt 2 is when you exploit some part of the environment or the context that otherwise would not factor in your action.
  * You recover 2 points to any of your Pools
  * You get a Destiny Point

Stunt 3
-------
A Stunt 3 is when the whole table looks at you in disbelief and erupts in yell or laughter.
  * You recover 3 points to any of your Pools
  * You get a Destiny Point
  * You get an Experience Point


DESTINY POINTS
==============
You get Destiny Points by stunting (Stunt 2 or Stunt 3).

You can spend them at any time to:
  * Reroll (you can use it also to allow another player to reroll)
  * Flashback
  * Player Intrusion
  * Refuse GM Intrusions


EXPERIENCE POINTS
=================
You get XPs:
  * When you discover something
  * When you do a Stunt 3
  * When you accept a GM Intrusion
  * When someone else accepts a GM Intrusion and gives their second XP to you


DEFINING ABILITY
================
By spending 8 XPs, a PC can upgrade a Mundane Ability from Specialized to Defining.
This does *not* count towards any Upgrade.
A character can have no more than *ONE* Defining Ability and the Defining Ability must be consistent with their Focus.


CYPHERS
=======
In general, a Cypher is not a supernatural effect, but just the character being really, really good at what she does.

When a player uses a Cypher, only the mechanical description is important, and the player must justify and describe the effect in a way that fits her character.

This description can take the form of special equipment (for example, to justify a ranged attack, the player could have her character extract a concealed knife from somewhere and throw it), special skill (for example, a special martial art style move, which should definitely have a name!) some item specifically prepared for a specific contingency (“I did suspect the blade was coated in venom, so I brought an anti-venom….”) or some other special skill or insight or knowledge.

Every time a character takes a Recovery Action, they get one new Cypher.

If this goes above their limit, they discard any excess Cypher.



COMBAT
======

Armor
-----
Wearing armor reduces Body by a given value when worn.
  - Using armor requires being Trained in Combat
  - Mundane light armor: soak 1, -3 Body
  - Mundane heavy armor: soak 2, -6 Body


Clinch
------
Clinch is a normal attack Action that inflicts no damage.

If the clinch is successful, the two characters become Controller and Victim.

Controller and Victim characters can only attack each other.

The Controller and anyone else can attack the Victim at -2 difficulty.

If the Controller attacks the Victim succesfully, they can inflict damage as normal.

If the Victim attacks the Controller successfully, they can break the clinch; on a Minor Effect the Victim can swap role with the Controller.
