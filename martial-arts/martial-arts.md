Styles and Mundane Abilities
----------------------------

Each martial art Style is based on a specific Mundane Ability.

All Attack and Parry rolls made while using the Style use this Ability instead of Combat.

> Four-Eyed Tiger is an old Officer of the Realm Treasury and she knows Seven Jade Talents Accounting Style, a martial arts Style based on the Bureaucracy Ability.
> Should Four-Eyed Tiger find herself in a fight, she could roll her Attack and Parry (but not Dodge) using her Bureaucracy instead of Combat.

Learning a new Martial Arts Style counts as an Ability Upgrade.

Unless otherwise noted, martial arts Styles can't be used while wearing armor.


Techniques
----------

Once a character has learned a Style, they can start learning the Style's Techniques.

Techniques must be learned in order.

Learning a new Technique does NOT count as an Ability Upgrade, it just costs XPs, but the exact cost is specified by the character's splat.

Many Styles have a *Form* Technique: only one Form Technique can be active at any given time.

Even if all Form Techniques are always `Action`, they can be activated as part of rolling initiative.


Combining Multiple Styles
-------------------------

If a character uses or has active Techniques from different Styles:
  * They must roll with the lowest of the Mundane Ability
  * They must use weapons that are compatible with all the Styles involved

> Four-Eyed Tiger knows both Seven Jade Talents Accounting Style, based on Bureaucracy, and Demon Dancing Style, based on Performance.
>
> She has activated Demon Dancing Form and she wants to attack with Seven Talents Strike, so her roll will use the lowest of her Bureaucracy and Performance.
>
> The only weapons allowed by both Styles are unharmed attacks, so for her attack she will not be able to use any weapon.
