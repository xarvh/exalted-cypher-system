Each martial art Style is based on a particular Mundane Ability.

All Attack, Dodge and Parry rolls made while using the style use the Mundane Ability the Style is based on instead of Combat.

> Four-Eyed Tiger is an old Officer of the Realm Treasury and she knows Seven Jade Talents Accounting Style, a Style based on the Bureaucracy Ability.
> Should Four-Eyed Tiger find herself in a fight, she could roll her Attack and Defense using her Bureaucracy instead of Combat.

If a PC is combining Special Abilities from more than one Style, roll the lowest of relevant the Mundane Abilities.

To learn a Style, a PC must be at least Trained in the Style's Mundane Ability.

Style Special Abilities of a specific Style must be learned in order; learning each Style Special Ability counts is an Ability Upgrade.

Many Styles have a Form technique: while a Form is being used, the Character can't use any Technique from other Styles.

Unless otherwise noted, Style Special Abilities can't be used with worn armor.
