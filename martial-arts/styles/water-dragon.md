Immaculate Water Dragon Style
=============================

Water Dragon teaches that all things are flow — the rhythm of a fight, the blood of a living body, the Essence of Creation.
Practitioners of this style train in techniques that block, redirect, or impede these flows, subtly manipulating the conditions of battle to seize victory.
Its defense emphasizes fluid motions and outmaneuvering enemies with footwork, while its offense relies on repeated strikes to wear off the opponent.
Water Dragon unarmed attacks emphasize swift sequences of punches, kicks, and claw strikes.

Mundane Ability: Combat

Weapons: Unarmed, tiger claws

*Water Dragon Style is compatible with light and medium armor.*


### Shrugging Water-Dragon Escape
`Body 2, Enabler`

*The Water Dragon’s fluid posture and footwork defies all restraint.*

+2 to Rolls to disengage or escape any kind of physical restraints, including clinches


### Flowing Water Defense
`Body 2, Enabler`

*The Water Dragon flows between offense and defense, lunging forward to strike before returning to a defensive posture.*

Effort used in a Defense roll can be used again to attack the same enemy.

The Water Dragon uses this Technique when spending Effort to Parry or Dodge against a particular enemy.

If she uses her next Action to Attack the enemy, she can apply the same Effort for free.

If she doesn't attack the enemy, the effect is lost.


### Drowning in Blood Technique
`Body 4, Enabler`

*Striking her foe’s chest with a rapid barrage, the Water Dragon redirects the flow of his blood so that it pours into his lungs.*

Increase damage by (Combat).

If target suffers more than 3 points of Body damage, they are at -1 until the end of the Scene as a Crippling effect.

This malus can be stacked only against spirits.


### Theft-of-essence Attack
`Body 6, Enabler`

*Landing a telling blow, the martial artist redirects the flow of a foe’s Essence.*

On a successful attack, the Water Dragon steals (Combat + excess success) points from the target's Essence pool, and chooses one ongoing Charm or Technique to disable.

Characters without an Essence Pool of their own can steal Essence but not store or use it, and are themselves completely immune to this Technique.


### Water Dragon Form
`Action`

*The Water Dragon wears down foes in an endless tide.*

Target must spend 1 more point per level of Effort to defend.

Pool-less enemies suffer 1 point of damage, ignoring Armor, even on failed attacks.


### Ghost Restraining Whirpool
`6 Body, Action, Scene Long`

*Moving through a winding kata, the Water Dragon stirs the seas of Essence that surround her, creating a maelstrom that inexorably draws in spirits.*

Any spirit in Short Range of the Water Dragon:
* must roll his Lore against her Combat to leave the range
* is completely prevented from using the Hurry Home Charm
* if dematerialised, suffers a penalty equal to (Combat) to all movement and Dodge rolls


### Bottomless Depths Defense
`Body 2 (no Edges), Enabler`

*The martial artist’s body ripples and deforms around a blow, dispersing its force into the bottomless abyss of her vitality.*

When Water Dragon takes Body damage because of an attack, she can decide to pay from any of her Pools instead (Body, Mind and Essence).

If the Attack has secondary effects that rely on inflicting damage and the only Body she pays is the cost of this Technique, the secondary effects are negated.


### Crashing Tsunami Force
`2 Body, Action`

*The Water Dragon strikes blow after furious blow, like waves pounding the shore.*

The Water Dragon keeps making attacks on the target until one attack fails or she's made 5 attacks, Edges count only once.

At that point, every character in an arc choosen by the Water Dragon (90 to 360 degrees) takes damage as an undodgeable, unblockable attack that inflicts damage equal to the number of successful attacks and ignores Armor.
Regardless of the arc choosen, the original target is always subject to this effect.
