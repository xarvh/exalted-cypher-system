White Reaper Style
==================

White Reaper style uses the long reach of a spear or scythe to take on great numbers of enemies at once.
The distinctive visual signature of this style is the white halo that engulfs its masters as they slay their foes, a corona of Essence that waxes as the martial artist slaughters her enemies and wanes as she uses powerful Techniques that discharge it.

### Snow Follows Winter
`Action`

*A brilliant flare of scarlet suffuses the silver halos of the White Reaperâ€™s corona, as if stained with the blood of countless enemies.
Then, in an instant, it flickers out, vanishing into her wounds and sealing them with a hissing burst of steam.*
