Dreaming Pearl Courtesan Style
==============================

Dreaming Pearl Courtesan is a subtle style: graceful, elusive, and lethal.

A student learns to maneuver herself into the perfect position to strike, gaining the confidence and trust of her victims as she navigates the veils of defenses they put up between themselves and the world.

Once the Dreaming Pearl Courtesan has reached her victim at his most vulnerable, whether that is in the tangle of his boudoir’s sheets, a friendly conversation in a tearoom, or a secret meeting at court, she reveals her true nature as a killer, fighting with a deadly grace and the elusiveness of a dream.

Mundane Ability: Presence or Socialize

Weapons: Unarmed


### Demure Carp Feint
`Mind 1, Enabler (Dodge or Parry)`

Defense rolls can use Mind instead of Body.


### Elegant Weapon Repertoire
`Enabler`

A paper fan, a colorful sash, a pair of chopsticks, a ball gown’s train: any socially appropriate accessory or item can be a killing weapon in the hands of a student of this style.

These accessories can be used as Light or Medium weapons, and where appropriate offer *one* of the following benefits:

* Accessories that are small or sharp enough to conceivably slip through the defenses of armor, such as hairpins, cutlery, a broken teacup, knitting needles, or elegantly decorated false nails, will ignore half of the target's Armor.

* Garments or accessories that can be used to leverage weapons out of their wielder’s grip (primarily sashes or sleeves that have had lead weights sewn into them for this specific purpose) can be used to Disarm an enemy without an Intrusion.

* Accessories and garments that could conceivably be used to entangle or tie up an enemy, such as the sash of a kimono, a long scarf, a ball gown train, a blanket or sheet, or a length of silken rope, ignore the penalty for establishing Clinches.

* Accessories and garments that seem well-suited to fending off attacks with their broad surface, such as paper fans, hand mirrors, or the long sleeves of a robe, give +1 to Parry.


### Pearlescent Filigree Defense
`Mind 5, Enabler`

An iridescent sheen comes over the martial artist’s garments as Essence enfolds them, turning silk as strong as steel.

For the remainder of the Scene, any clothing the martial artist wears is treated as having Armor equal to (Socialize + 1).


### Dreaming Pearl Courtesan Form
`Action`

The martial artist may make attacks out to Short range, slashing a fan to unleash a razor-edged wind, letting a silk sash flow like a weaving serpent to strike enemies and so on.

Weapons readied with Elegant Weapon Repertoire gain +1 to Attack.

Any clothing she enchants with Pearlescent Filigree Defense is considered indestructible like an artifact.

No amount of combat fatigue or environmental factors will alter the artist's make up and hair.


### Fragrant Petal Fascination Kata
????
`Mind 6, Action`

*Moving through the sultry, languid forms of a hypnotic kata, the Dreaming Pearl Courtesan beguiles her enemies with ethereal music and the fragrant scent of flower petals.*

The martial artist rolls Presence or Performance, adding her Socialize as bonus.

Any opponent who is looking at the martial artist must oppose this roll with their Integrity: on failure,
