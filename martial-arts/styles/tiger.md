Tiger Style
===========

The tiger has little need for cunning strategy.
She can hide and stalk her victim, but the moment she spots weakness, she leaps, roaring, to kill.
Sheer, ferocious power brings victory to the tiger.
Martial artists who emulate the tiger rely on swift, lethal attacks.
They often share the tiger’s fierce confidence of victory as well.
No foe is too powerful to tear down.
No defense is so perfect that it lasts forever.
In the end, the tiger’s strength and speed must triumph.
Tiger Style martial artists can become arrogant, impatient or casually cruel from their certainty that they can simply defeat anyone who stands in their way.
Like many supernatural martial arts inspired by animals, Tiger Style is old beyond memory.
