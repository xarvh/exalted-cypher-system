Crystal Chameleon Style
=======================

This ancient Celestial martial art dates back to the Primordial War, when it was innovated and used by the Chosen of Mercury to help deliver vital messages despite overwhelming Primordial opposition.
Demons and Lintha alike were left blinking and confused as practitioners quickly blurred through their blockades, leaving only footprints and corpses to mark their passing.
It is still strongly favored today for its mixture of surprise and speed.
Those who have fought a Blinding Prism (as practitioners of this style are known) rarely know precisely what hit them, and that suits the needs of the Viziers of the Second Age perfectly.

Mundane Ability: Stealth

Weapons: Spear, rope dart, weighted rope


### Just Another Branch Deceit
`2 Mind, Action`

*The Blinding Prism hides in plain sight, blending with the features of the surrounding environment.*

Unless the environment is completely featureless, the Prism can roll Stealth to attempt hiding.

In combat, she can roll Stealth against a target: if successful the Prism's next Attack against that target is considered an ambush.


### Razor-Edged Prism Assault
`Action`

*Accelerating into a flickering blur of unleashed violence, the Blinding Prism strikes a foe from many angles.*

Max Effort that can be spent for this attack is increased by 3.


### Crystal Chameleon Form
`Action`

While the Form is active, *Just Another Branch Deceit* is considered Enabler and costs 0.
You can establish an ambush and attack, benefitting from the advantage of the ambush, as a single Action (Edges apply only once).


### Flashing Leaves Evasion
`6 Body, Enabler`

*Putting on a sudden burst of speed, the martial artist melts into a blur as an attack closes in on her, briefly disappearing and reappearing to evade the blow.*

This Charm can be used only once per round, and provides a bonus to Dodge equal to whatever value is required to successfully Dodge the attack.
The Prism reappears a Short distance away from her previous position.
Can't be used against Undodgeable or unexpected attacks.


### Death From Nowhere Method
`3 Body, Enabler`

*In one moment the battlefield is serene; in the next, the martial artist has already struck.*

Allows to roll to re-establish Stealth immediately *after* an attack.
If the roll overcomes a +2 threshold, the Prism is completely unseen and no Counterattack can be used against her.
