Mantis Style
============

Mundane Ability: Awareness

Weapons: Unarmed, baton, kama, nunchaku, war fan, seven-section staff


The deceptive and deadly mantis combines patience with haste.

She seems remote, though approachable in her stillness.

Her small, precise movements seem too small to warn of any danger.

When her prey comes too close, however, the mantis strikes with incredible speed and savage strength.

Martial artists who emulate the mantis use small, irregular steps forward, back and side to side to break their opponentâ€™s rhythm while holding their hands poised, giving no clue when they intend to strike.

When the opponent momentarily moves too close and off balance, the Mantis stylist traps him in a dread embrace.

Mantis Style includes lightning-fast chops and punches, but its greatest strength lies in blocking attacks and disarming or disabling a foe without killing him.

Mantis Style is exceedingly ancient. It certainly dates back to the first Exalted and the war against the Primordials.

The wisest of the Exalted and the gods (except for perhaps the Maiden of Secrets) do not know who invented it.

### Joint-Breaking Technique
`5 Body, Action (Attack)`

The Attacker uses this Technique when attacking a target she Controls in a Clinch.

The Attacker decides whether to break or disable one of the target's limbs or joints.

Breaking inflicts the normal damage of the clinch Attack, while disabling inflicts zero damage.

Regardless of the choice, the target suffers a penalty of -3 to anything that requires use of the limb or joint.

Because of the overwhelming pain, the target also suffers a penalty of -1 to everything.


### Unfolding Retribution Stance
`5 Body, Enabler`

Until the next Action, get a Counterattack *before* any enemy attack.
