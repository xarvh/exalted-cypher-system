Righteous Devil Style
=====================

Mundane Ability: Integrity

Weapons: Firewand

The Righteous Devil is a figure of burning fury and solemn judgment, a wandering hero who protects the innocent and banishes the wicked into a fiery hell of their own making.

Students of the style master the firewand, wielding these exotic weapons with a deadly precision that’s more art than archery.

However, the heart of the Righteous Devil style is not in its fiery attacks, but in the judgment that precedes them.

When the strong and powerful use their positions to oppress those beneath them, when the selfish put their own needs above those of the community, when the once-righteous turn from their ideals to pursue their own desires—these are the crimes which the Righteous Devil judges most harshly, and his verdict is spoken in cleansing flames.

Many students of this style hold principles encompassing this code of ethics, though there are some who turn against the moral teachings of their sifus, or who simply learn the martial techniques of the style with no heed for the ethics behind them.


Firewands
---------
Firewands can be Light, Medium or Heavy.

They have Short Range and inflict +1 damage.

Most firewands must be reloaded after every shot, but more expensive ones exist that can fire multiple times before needing to reload.

Reloading a firewand takes one Action.

Firewands use firedust as ammo.


### Blossom of Inevitable Demise
`Enabler`

Increases the Max Effort that can be used to enhance attacks by (Integrity)


### Righetous Devil Form
`Action`

*Creation itself holds its breath as the stylist cloaks herself in the majestic and terrible stillness of the Righteous Devil Form.
An inescapable gravity exudes from her confident, unwavering posture, sending the innocent scurrying away to safety and calling the unjust to reap the whirlwind of judgment they’ve sown.*

Anyone who witnesses the Righteous Devil instinctively knows that she is about to pass judgement.

The innocent take their children and run to safety.

The wicked are filled with the dread of the inevitable, suffering a penalty equal to the Righteous Devil's (Integrity) to Stealth and to any roll to run away, resist intimidation or instil them with emotions of shame, guilt or remorse as appropriate to their sins.

Once per turn, the Righteous Devil can roll, adding her Integrity as a bonus, to compel one enemy to attack her.
This effect succeeds automatically if the Sun is at high noon.

Firewands can be used as melee weapons, to attack and parry, but Heavy firewands count only as Medium.

Ranged attacks made with firewands and the Techniques of this Style can spend Mind instead than Body.


### Azure Abacus Meditation
`Body 6, Action (Attack)`

Closing her eyes, the Righteous Devil perceives the ebb and flow of Essence around her through a mandala of blue rings, nine notched discs of silver-blue light that spin around her foes in her mind’s eye.
If her anima banner is at the bonfire level, this azure abacus becomes visible to all within its light, the silvery rings orbiting around the stylist and aligning as she lines up a shot.
Firing through this reticule mandala hones in on an enemy’s weakest point.

The attack can reach up to Long range and ignores all physical sources of Armor (including artifact armor) but not Armor directly granted by supernatural effects.


### Burning Judgment Halo
`Body 5, Action`

Pointing the tip of her firewand at the ground, the stylist draws the Burning Judgment Halo, an arc or ring of flames that encompasses all characters at close range to her.

The flames inflict (Integrity + 3) environmental damage per round.

The flames created by this Charm will continue to burn for as long as the Righteous Devil remains at their center.
Once she takes a movement action to move from that point, they will continue to burn for a single round more, then die down on her next turn.
Moving through the blaze created by this Charm never damages the stylist—the devil walks through hell unscathed.


### Dancing Devil Trigger Finger
`Body 2 per target, Action`

As a single Action, the Righteous Devil can attack every enemy in range once.
Edge is applied only once.


### Caress of 1,000 Hells
`Body 8, Enabler (Attack)`

*There is no sin beyond redemption in the fires stoked by the Righteous Devil.*

A successful attack enhanced by the Caress of 1,000 Hells sets an enemy ablaze with the fires of judgment, engulfing him in a swirling vortex of cobalt and gold flames.
Within this hellish pyre, disembodied voices recount his sins and misdeeds, and offer him a single choice—repent, or burn.

If the enemy chooses to repent, the flames fade away, leaving him changed but unscathed.
He forms a Defining Intimacy reflecting the nature of his atonement, chosen by that character’s player.
A Guild merchant prince who has made his fortune in the slave trade might form a Defining Tie of hatred for all slavers, while a hedonistic Abyssal mass murderer might form a Defining Principle of pacifism and simple living.
An enemy who has atoned will generally retreat or surrender and won't be able to reestablish hostilities.

On the other hand, if an enemy chooses to burn, the aftermath is far simpler: the damage of the attack in increased by 10.
