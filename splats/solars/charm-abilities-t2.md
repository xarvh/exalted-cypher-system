Each attack is rolled separately but Edges are applied only once.

**Heavenly Guardian Defense**
"The Anathema may strike aside even the falling sky"
(Body 10, Enabler, instant)

Any damage the target suffers is awarded to her as Essence.
A spirit slain by this attack is destroyed permanently.

**Judgeâ€™s Ear Technique**

When someone says something, the Solar knows if they believe in it or not.
A roll is necessary only if the lie is enhanced by a supernatural effect.

**Keen Understanding of the Core Imperfection**

On touch, gain perfect understanding of how to destroy, dismantle or demolish a construct or inanimate object.
If an object is indestructible, the Solar will still find a way, difficult as it might be.

As an alternative, she inflicts 4 times the damage on that object.
