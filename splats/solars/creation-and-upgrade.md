Upgrading and Tiering Up
========================

Whenever dramatically appropriate, Solars can pay 4xp to learn the Technique of a Martial Arts Style they know.

For each Tier, the Solar has the following Upgrades:
  * Increase Max Effort by 1
  * Add 1 Edge
  * Add 5 to her Pools (Mind, Body, Essence)
  * A Mundane Ability OR a Martial Arts Style
  * A Caste Charm
  * A Caste or non-Caste Charm

When the six upgrades above are done, the Solar tiers up and receives all the benefits of the next Tier of her Focus.
