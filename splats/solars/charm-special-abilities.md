### Mist on Water Attack
`Body 2 per turn, Enabler`

** The Solar pours the cold instinct of her training into a blade, suffusing it with stifling Essence. **

A victim of this attack cannot produce sound.
He can neither cry out nor raise alarm, nor will his fist through a window produce the sound of shattered glass, nor will his body plummeting from the rooftops to the street make even the tiniest sound of thud
or splatter.
Characters thus affected may not be detected by any hearing-based Perception, and those who are killed will die in an unnoticeable fashion, determined by the GM: they may die standing up, reclining naturally, or their bodies may simply fall soundlessly out of sight.
In any case, the target’s death cannot be discovered until the effects of Mist on Water Attack have passed.



## Tier 4

Her arrow flies up and up, disappearing into the sky.

If one opponent crosses through, over, or into the designated position, the fiery arrow strikes them as if the Solar had rolled a 6.

If the Solar is slain or cancels the Essence commitment, the arrow comes down and will set fire to any flammable thing it touches.

If the Lawgiver threatens a specific character with this attack, (ie “Winglord Kvetu may not retreat across that bridge”) the attack adds (Tier) to both the attack roll and the arrow's damage.

Any use of this Charm must occur in places with enough vertical space to fire an arrow upward without it getting lodged in the ceiling.

# Zenith


## Tier 1


### Iron-Kettle Body
`Enabler`

This bonus does not stack with worn Armor, but can stack with other sources of Armor.

### ??? Soul-Firing Performance
``

The Storyteller chooses what each character is forced to reconsider.


### Spirit-Tied Pet
`Enabler`

** An Exalt with a familiar has experienced the gift of having been chosen twice. **

* No influence of any kind can make the familiar act against their loyalty for the Solar
* The familiar is protected against attacks and effects that do not target them directly
* The Exalt may borrow the sense of the familiar thought a moment of intense concentration.
  This renders the Solar incapable of taking any other action.


### Traceless Camouflage
`Mind 6, Enabler`

The Lawgiver can hide herself, her followers and objects up to the size of an elephant in any environment.

If standing in a place, they must spend time to camouflage:
  * 1 Action for one person
  * 1 minute for a handful of people
  * 1 hour for a large object
  * half a day for many people or objects

Once the camouflage is complete, they cannot be detected with mundane means.

If moving, they cannot be tracked with mundane means.

Against magical means, the Solar adds her Tier to the roll.



## Tier 2


### Fury-Inciting Speech
[a bit too limited?]
`Mind 5, Action`

`Body 5, Enabler`

** The Lawgiver knows all harm at once, and yet the greater truth is that she still exists, unbowed and unbroken. **

This charms lessens physical crippling effects.

Temporary penalties are halved, rounding down, and their duration cannot exceed (4 - Resitance) actions.

Irreparable or permanent harm can be traded for a lesser effect of a shorter duration: instead of her eye being gouged out, it is closed by a glancing blow; instead of her arm being shattered, it simply hangs limp.


### Underling-Promoting Touch
`Essence 3, Action`

** With a touch, the Exalt raises a servant to the role of a champion. **

By touching a person who serves or follows her, the Lawgiver temporarily makes her subject the beneficiary of respect and admiration usually reserved for the Solar.

Characters who have ties of loyalty, respect or admiration to the Solar now also feel the same way toward her charge.

The character also inherits any social station or role it is within the Solar’s right to grant, and all characters who are subject to that station instantly recognize that they are subject to the promoted one’s authority.

## Tier 3


### Adamant Skin Technique
`Body 5, Enabler, instant`

** Driven by purpose, the Solar refuses to be defeated. **

This Charm is activated on taking damage to her Body Pool and can be used even in case of a surprise attack: the Solar rolls Resistence, removing the result from the damage.

As an alternative, the Charm grants total immunity to scenery-based damage, like that of an explosion or a collapse, or falling from a great height.


### Life-Sustaining Shelter Preparation
`Essence 8, long Action`

** The Solar Exalted may survive anywhere. **

Once she has found an area large enough to protect all of her followers, the Solar places representations of the five elements at the center and directional boundaries of the area, which can be actual examples of each element, such as twigs, stone, cinders, etc, or the Solar may use a few drops of blood, paper effigies, Dragon-Blooded willing to sit still or other tokens.
Doing so blesses the area with her essence, claiming it as her dominion and making it Holy.

All individuals within the shelter are treated as if under the effect of Hardship-Surviving Mendicant Spirit and the shelter itself is immune to the inclement conditions of the environment: the Wyld will not mutate the camp’s land, the Solar’s followers, or their belongings, nor will Malfeas’s toxic miasma poison them.
The Solar and her followers may respire Essence normally even in the Underworld or the Blight Zones of Autochthonia.

The Solar’s followers will take no harm from any nourishment scavenged within the confines of the shelter: Wyld berries will not poison them, nor singing fish give them mutations, the iridescent locusts which swarm across the sands of Cecelyne will not infect them with demonic taint.
The shelter confines will provide enough food to feed all the Solar's followers even if there no food: as if produced by faith alone, the Solar finds clean water flowing from the rocks of Malfeas, fresh fish in the acrid seas of Kimbery, and living fruit upon dead branches.


### Majestic Radiant Presence
[should this be permanent? should it make Stealth impossible while active?]
`Enabler`

** The Lawgiver is a singular and terrifying being, awesome to behold. **

The Solar gains +2 bonus to any intimidation roll.

Anyone wishing to initiate combat or speak against her must overcome this fear effect, whether the Solar is aware of them or not.

A character that overcomes this effect will be immune to it for the rest of the Scene.


### Memory-Reweaving Discipline
`Mind 6, Enabler`

** The Exalt weaves a narrative so plausible and compelling that those who hear it forget the truth and believe the narrative. **

The Solar speaks for at least a minute, though more complex narratives may require longer.
Mere success entails a simple belief in the facts as the Solar has presented them.
Extra successes, however, increase commitment to this belief.


### Truth Shines Through
`Enabler`

** The virtue of the Lawgivers is like the sun at noon. Clouds might obscure it, but its light can never truly be banished or denied. **

Whenever the Solar act under some unnatural mental influence, the fact that she is not behaving like herself becomes obvious to all the observers.



## Tier 4


### Destiny-Manifesting Method
``

** The Solar is the heritor of a legend that cannot easily be erased. **

When struck with a reality-shaping or fate-weaving attack that would permanently alter her mind or body, the Solar’s destiny manifests to override the changes.
This Charm does not completely nullify deleterious effects, but downgrades or slows them such that two things are guaranteed:
  1. the Solar cannot be immediately changed beyond her ability to represent the character concept implied by her Caste and Focus [is this flexible/good enough?].
  2. no matter how fatal or permanent the effect may be, fate itself will generate a condition by which the Solar may shatter any curse.

Once the condition is shattered once, it cannot affect the Solar again, applying a minimal penalty for an action or paltry damage at worst.


### ??? Heart-Compelling Method
``

** The Lawgiver’s music pulls at the soul of her target, impelling him to act on his deepest desires. **

The Solar performs for at least a minute, declaring an emotion that she wants to arouse in her audience.

The Solar doesn't need to know her audience: the performance will automatically revive the audience memories and experiences that are more likely to lead to the intended emotion.

The emotion will be aroused automatically, even if the audience is hostile.

On a successful Performance Roll however, the audience will feel strongly compelled to act on the emotion, if not immediately very soon.


### Mind-Blanking Rebuke
`???`

** The Lawgiver issues a powerful admonition against a target, forbidding him from taking a certain action. **

Social attack, prevents a target from taking a certain action (usually the purview of a single Mundane Ability) for the rest of the Scene.


### ??? Bloodthirsty Sword-Dancer Spirit
``

** The Solar drops to a deeper level of consciousness, sinking into a meditation on violence and destruction. **

* +2 to all Combat Rolls
* Ignore penalties for zeroed Pools
* Ignore penalties due to pain
* Regenerates 1 more Essence per action, 2 when tremendousy outnumbered

In this fugue state, her world
narrows to a tight red tunnel with things that must die at
the far end. On top of the +1 bonus from Battle Fury Focus,
the Solar gains an additional +2 dice to all of her combat
actions, ignores all wound penalties, and generates one
mote per turn, which must be spent each turn on combat-
related actions or physical actions in pursuit of combat,
violence or destruction.

In this state the Solar cannot be safely dissuaded from combat.
Should friends or allies choose to stand in her way, she won’t slaughter them unheedingly, but will use any force necessary to remove them from her path so she can continue to assault her original target.
She will not, and cannot end her assault until her targets are dead or fled, and if she is convinced by an impassioned plea to drop her commitment to this Charm, [adverse consequences].


## Tier 5


### ??? God-King benevolence
[overlaps Life-Sustaining Shelter Preparation?]
``

** When faced with the unmitigated purity of the sun’s light, all lesser forces must bow. **

The unbound anima of the Solar Exalted subverts the wrath of nature, cowing the elements in order ensure the safety of the followers of the sun.
By voluntarily flaring her anima into an enormous pillar of light, the Solar banishes the wrathful elements.
Lava flows part or harden to admit the passage of the Solar’s followers.
Flesh-scouring sandstorms whirl about and leave them untouched.


### Horizon-to-Horizon Performance Method
`Mind 14, Enabler`

** By the authority of the Unconquered Sun, his Chosen may command the very heavens to become a vessel for their glory. **

Can be used only during the day under the open sky.
Tweaking sunlight, shaping clouds and channelling her voice through thunder the Solar creates a performance in the sky that is inescapably seen and heard by everyone for hundred of miles.


### Immunity to Everything Technique
[is this actually fun or it just removes dramatic options?]
``

  * Invulnerable to any mundane toxin or disease.
  * Invulnerable to any toxin or disease she has ever been exposed previously.
  * Reduces Difficulty to resist by 3 if they are resistible.
  * Can roll to resist toxin or disease that would be non-resistible.
  * Reduces their adverse effects and their duration by half.


### ??? Saga Beast Virtue
`6 Essence, Action`

** The Exalt infuses her familiar with Solar anima, unlocking the form of the sacred beast. **

  * increase size up to an elephant's
  * increase level
  * mutations
  * immune to fear
  * lethal damage will terminate the charm, but keep the familiar alive
  * armor


### Terrible Sun King Condemnation
`Mind 12, Enabler`

** As the Chosen of the Unconquered Sun, the Solar Exalted are empowered on behalf of their patron to determine Creation’s true enemies, even if they walk in the guise of the righteous. **

When the Solar rolls a social attack to condemn, castigate or revile a subject, the subject is given the chance to counter argument the Solar.
If the subject fails, the day dims slightly and the subject is permanently marked as a creature of darkness and an enemy of Creation, vulnerable to Holy effects.



## Tier 6


### Cast Out Beyond Regard
`10 Mind, Action`

** A Solar may exile those who have proven themselves unworthy to exist in the world she rules. **

Strips out a confined geographical location from Creation and consigns it to the Demon City.

The Lawgiver performs a prayer where she condemns the targeted area or people, which must be uttered within earshot of at least one affected individual.

Creation’s Essence sizzles and screams, the boundaries of the cursed area blacken, char, and erupt into flights of blind doves.

A patina of silver sand drips from the stars.

At the end of the prayer, the entire targeted region and all inhabitants who have not fled or established Shaping defenses are torn from Creation in a surge of crimson Essence.

Where the targeted region stood, there is only a plain of black glass holding Ligier’s sullen reflection; he speaks a grudging word of ritual thanks for the Solar’s offering, and then vanishes.

The targeted region is deposited somewhere within a random layer of the Demon City, which reflexively reorganizes its geography to make room for the new arrival.

The lethal miasma of Malfeas avoids such imported bits of Creation, but this is the only mercy the new deportees are granted; demons are always quite interested in the novelty of a freshly-arrived army encampment or city, and soon come to investigate.

The Difficilty of the roll depends on the size of the affected area:
  * 9 for a town
  * 11 city
  * 13 region
  * 15 nation


### Eternal Empress of Love Attitude
`8 committed Essence, Enabler`

For as long as the Solar keeps the Essence committed, any character in existence who has a positive opinion of the Solar must overcome the Solar's (Presence + 6) every time they wish to deliberately take some action they believe will bring harm to the Solar (physical, emotional, political or even financial).

Successfully overcoming the effect for three times makes the character immune to it for the rest of the Scene.


### ??? Rising Sun Renewal
``
** Perfection is the nature of the Solar Exalted, and the best efforts of the world cannot draw them away from that state for long. **

The Solar’s Essence surges and begins to catalyze, producing a crackling, charged feeling in the air around her, as though a storm were about to commence.


### Sublime Cosmic Transcendence
`Mind 10`

** Temporarily absolving herself from the ties that make her transient and definite, the Solar is everything and nothing and sees all things truly. **

This Charm cannot be used in a Scene in which the Exalt has attacked or otherwise harmed another character, and it will terminate immediately if she does so while it is active.

The Solar must meditate deeply for at least 5 minutes, after which she enters a state of complete merging with the Essence of existence.

She becomes a natural facet of existence, equal to and unaffected by all things.

  * Having left her will behind herself, she cannot use any level of Effort.

  * Her body, mind and soul cannot be harmed, controlled or adversely affected in any way other than normal social influence.

  * She sees all things truly: any unnatural mental influence or delusion affecting her is permanently shattered.

  * She has unlimited Essence.

  * The time she spends meditating can be used for Recovery.



# Twilight


## Tier 1


### Crafty Observation Method
`Mind 4, Action`

** When the Lawgiver inquires, Creation immediately yields its secrets bare. **

The Lawgiver concentrates on the scene she is surveying, exposing the very essence of all the objects around her.
In her mind furniture moves, carpets lift, drawers open, books flip their pages.
In a single action she can complete a search that would take 15 minutes, and she doesn't actually touch or move anything.
Further, she adds her Tier to notice deliberate tampering with any evidence.
If the scene contains at least one lead for the Solar's inquiry, she is guaranteed to find it.

She cannot search objects that she could not normally access such as locked chests or items held by people who are not willing to let her search them.

By committing 1 Mind, she can perfectly recall the whole scene survey.


### Durability-Enhancing Techinque
`Mind 5, Enabler, Scene`

`Mind 5, Extended Action, Permanent`

Increase the difficulty to damage an object of up to `Tier + 2` radius by Tier + 2.

### Wyld-Dispelling Prana
`Mind 6, Enabler, 1+ Actions`

Roll Lore to repel a Wyld Shaping effect happening withing Short range, with 2 Assets.

For any excess levels in the roll, the target is immune to Wyld warping for one turn.



## Tier 2


### Ghost-Eating Technique
`Mind or Body 2, Attack`

Allows a normal attack to strike spirits even if they are immaterial and deal twice the damage.

Any damage the target suffers is awarded to her as Essence.

A spirit slain by this attack is destroyed permanently.


### Irresistible Questioning Technique
`Mind 5, Action`

** The Lawgiver may wring the truth from a subject with piercing, impossible-to-resist questions. **

The Lawgiver asks a question and the target is compelled to answer.

If the target uses an appropriate supernatural mental defense, leaves the scene or attacks her, then the Solar needs to roll Presence + Tier.
Otherwise, the success is automatic and no roll is required.

In case of success, the target is compelled to answer truthfully and to the fullest extent of his knowledge.


### Keen Understanding of the Core Imperfection
`Mind 4, Action`

On touch, gain perfect understanding of how to destroy, dismantle or demolish a construct or inanimate object.

If an object is indestructible, the Solar will still find a way, difficult as it might be.

On anything else she reduces the Difficulty to half and the time to one tenth.

As an alternative, she inflicts 4 times the damage on that object.

## Tier 3


### Empathic Recall Discipline
``
* see a scene from the perspective of one of the partecipants
* understand the intention of a perpetrator after surveying a scene



## Tier 4


### Evidence-Discerning Method
`Mind 8, Action`

** The Lawgivers see into others’ hearts. **

By sorting through possessions, physical evidence and other information left by a particular person, the Exalt may construct a psychological profile of the character who left the evidence.

The base Difficulty is 5, but it should be adjusted by the amount of evidence available and how much it is actually indicative of the target's personality.
In case of success, the profile is guaranteed to be non-misleading but how specific it is depends on the extra successes.
Further evidence can be used to refine the profile.

Once the profile is created, the Lawgiver will automatically notice any and all characters that meet that profile.

With a sufficiently accurate profile, the Lawgiver can Roll ??? one week before an individual she has profiled is planning to undertake any sort of premeditated larcenous enterprise; examples might include robbing a bank, staging a kidnapping, attempting an assassination, or, in the case of the Yozis, escaping from Hell.
Success grants the Solar an idea of what the subject plans to do, including at least the general location, and nature of the crime: "Splendid Magister is planning to illegally experiment on hun souls within a private, hidden manse on the Blessed Isle", "the Ebon Dragon is going to try to break out of Hell with the assistance of a Yozi cult in Denandsor" or "Tammuz is going to attempt to murder his lover aboard a pleasure yacht."



## Tier 5

  ??? tells you when someone is about to use Larceny



## Tier 6

# Night



## Tier 1


### Flawless Pickpocketing Technique
`Mind 3, Action`

** With hands quicker than the eye, the Exalt relieves a hapless soul of his material burden. **

Automatically succeed on a mundane pickpocketing attempt.

Gives 3 Assets when contested with magic.

Cannot be used to pick items in use or attuned artifacts.


### Graceful Crane Stance
`Permanent`

** The Solar is as graceful as sunlight on water. **

The Solar has Perfect balance: she can stand or run on things normally too weak or narrow, with no chance of falling or breaking through.

She can run on a guy wire, stand on a crumbling parapet, balance on the tip of a pine tree, and perform many similar feats without needing to roll for her balance.


### Invisible Statue Spirit
`Mind 5, Action to initiate`

** Assuming perfect stillness, the Solar fades from sight. **

A Solar with this Charm can affect true invisibility.
However, the Exalt cannot move, nor can she take violent action without breaking this deception.

Characters using Invisible Statue Spirit are not immaterial and can still be detected by touch, scent, taste but not hearing.


### Lock-Opening Touch
`Mind 4, Action`

Open any lock mechanism.

Mundane locks are opened automatically, no Roll or lockpicking tools are required.

Magical locks require a (Larceny + Tier) Roll: on a failure the lock is opened but a GM Intrusion occours.


### Shadow Over Water
`Body 2, Enabler`

Reduces the Difficulty of a Dodge roll by 2, can be used *after* the die has been cast.

Edges apply as if the Charm was used together with the Dodge roll.


### Surprise Anticipation Method
`Enabler`

** The Solar’s senses guard her from threats she is not consciously aware of. **

Whenever the Solar is in danger, due to a hidden enemy, a trap or any source of harm not readily apparent, she will know that something is off.

In order to reveal the actual nature of the threat, she will still need to roll Perception, but she can pay 1 point less per level of Effort.

Her senses will function even when she is asleep or knocked out or otherwise unconscious: if she successfully detects the threat, she will instantly revive to try and defend herself.



# Tier 2


### Easily-Overlooked Presence Method
`Mind 6, Enabler, Scene long`

** Even amidst the Imperial Treasury, the Lawgiver projects her right to be there. **

As long as the Solar does not stand out, her presence there will slip away from any onlooker's mind, like an irrelevant extra.

Things that usually will count as "standing out" are taking overt action, attacking and general displays of prowess: leaping from the street to the rooftops, braving a snowstorm in summer clothes, etc.

If she is dressed and behaving as expected for the present circumstances, those that interact with her by matter of routine won't find her suspicious.

Even if she was caught somewhere she doesn't belong, she will immediately become aware of a gap in her inquisitor’s knowledge she can exploit: stopped at a picket, she realizes the soldier questioning her is expecting a messenger he has never seen; confronted by a tenant when creeping through the glass towers of Chiaroscuro, she realizes there are vacant rooms and assumes the role of a squatter.


### Flawlessly Impenetrable Disguise
`Mind 5, Action, Scene long`

** Master chameleons, the Solars donned disguises and attended the fetes of the raksha, to hear them confess their nefarious plans for Creation. **

The Solar can don a different gender, etnicity, voice, accent, scent, as well as double or halve her age, increase or decrease height by up to 25cm, creating a completely new appearance or impersonating someone specific.

Identity is Perfectly disguised, deception can be detected only with magic means (roll Larceny + Tier to contest).

Characters are not entitled to attempt to see through the disguise unless the Solar behaves in a grossly inaccurate way.

Setting up the disguise takes about 5 minutes.

At Tier 4, she can even mock the features of magical beings: her hair might stand on end and crackle with lightning; she might hover inches off the ground or display the anima of a different kind of Exalt.
None of these displays are real: displaying a Fire Aspect’s anima will not actually burn anything, though witnesses will feel the intensity of its heat.
She may appear to float, but her feet are still touching the ground.


### Keen Sight Technique
`Mind 8, Enabler, Scene long`

** The Lawgiver's visual acuity transcends mortal limits. **

* +Tier to notice hidden persons or devices, to catch sleight of hand and see through disguises.

* In dim conditions, the Lawgiver sees as well as in broad daylight.

* Reduce the penalties due to environmental visual hindrances such as dense smoke or fog by 2: these effects reflect the Exalt’s ability to notice and process hundreds of minute details, as well as to focus and manage light sources more effectively.

* She can resolve tiny details at distance.

* She can quickly estimate distances, sizes and numbers on sight, for example to count enemy troops, dropped coins.


### Lightning-Hand Sleight

** Long ago, the Solars stole the implements of their virtue from beneath the gaze of the gods’ own masters. **

Between breaths, eyeblinks, even thoughts, the Exalt’s hands flash out.

This Charm is used to perform a sleight of hand in plain sight as if every onlooker was momentarily distracted.

Further, the change cannot be noticed for (Larceny + Tier) minutes unless the circumstances call attention to it, such as a soldier attempting to draw his stolen blade.


### Seven Shadows Evasion
`Mind 2 and Body (special cost), Enabler, instant`

** The Solar’s perfect form is quicker than an eyeblink and more tractile than water. **

The Solar can dodge *anything* physical, even if it's Undodgeable, no roll required.

The Body cost is equal to the level of the attack but can never exceed 8 points.


### Ten Aurochs Meditation
`Body 3, Enabler`

This Charm increases the effects of using Effort for a single action or task where raw strength matters.

Any level of Effort used for feats of strength (usually lifting or breaking stuff) is multiplied by the Solar's Athletics.

If an attack damage can be affected by the Solar's strength, then each level of Effort will increase the damage by (3 + Athletics).



## Tier 3


### Keen Taste and Smell Technique + Foe Scenting Method
`Mind 8, Enabler, Scene long`

** The Exalt’s senses of taste and smell are capable of flawless identification of flavors, textures, and scent profiles. **

The Solar perfectly remembers all the scents and flavours she has experienced and will automatically recognize them when this Charm is active.

She can identify obscure, complex, or similar flavors and she can deconstruct a meal she has eaten to its basic ingredients, so long as she has experienced most of the flavors at some point in time.

She has +2 to Survival Rolls to hunt for food, track a character, or find water using her sense of smell.

She can recognize an individual by scent alone and tell older scents from new ones, enabling her to tell how recently an individual was present; even if a scent is not known to her, she can make generally accurate discernments about what kind of being a scent belongs to: beasts, for example, smell different than humans, as do the undead and spirits.

At Tier 3+ she can smell dematerialized spirits.


### Perfect Shadow Stillness
`Essence 3, Enabler`

**The Lawgiver’s stealth technique is honed until it’s flawless. **

After a failure or GM Intrusion on a Stealth Roll, the player gets a free Player Intrusion.


### Proof-Eating Palm
`Mind 3, Action`

** The Solar’s genius hands can outwit even the sharpest eye. **

This Charm allows her to hide any object small enough to palm.
She may appear to swallow the item, fit it under her tongue, hide it up her sleeve, etc. The object vanishes.
When the Exalt needs it again she may will it into her hand with just a thought.
The Exalt may hide no more than (Larceny x2) objects, but each object must be hidden in a separate space.


### Racing the Sun
`2 Body, Enabler`

** Attuned to Essence currents that flow through the world, the Solar moves as if in a waking dream. **

Multiply running speed by (Tier + Athletics) for a single Action.
During a chase, add Tier to any roll to outrun an opponent.
Lasts for a single Action.


### Safety Between Heartbeats
`Body 1, Enabler`

** In making herself untouchable, the Lawgiver exploits the slightest hesitation, even the pause to draw breath, maximizing her opponent’s failure. **

This Charm enhances a roll to Dodge an attack.
Whether the roll is successful or not, the attacker's next action suffers a penalty equal to the Solar's Athletics.



## Tier 4


### Flow Like Blood
`Body 8, Action`

For the rest of the Scene, any Dodge roll benefits from the full Max Effort without cost.


### Hundred Shadow Ways
???
After successfully dodging an attack, the Exalt may ac-
tivate this Charm to remember a single Charm used in
the attack. She feels its spiritual form and pressure as
a physical thing and understands how to dodge it. For
the remainder of the scene, she perfectly evades the
effects of that Charm. Hundred Shadow Ways cannot
be used against the Excellency Charm of any Ability,
nor can it be used against sorcery or Evocations. Fur-
thermore, if the Exalt falls into Initiative Crash, this
Charm ends.

Say you’ve used this Charm to lock out Hungry Tiger
Technique. An attack enhanced solely by Hungry Tiger
Technique automatically fails. Now the opponent throws
a combination of Hungry Tiger Technique and Fire and
Stones Strike—the attack still occurs, but Hundred
Shadow Ways automatically removes the benefit of
Hungry Tiger Technique from the attack. This Charm
can be used to “learn” as many Charms as the Exalt’s
mote pool can afford.


### Keen Hearing and Touch Technique
`Mind 8, Enabler, Scene long`

** The Lawgiver listens with the intensity of an owl, and feels movement in the world like a spider feels a touch against its web. **

Perception is counted twice on Rolls that are based on hearing or touch.

The Exalt may identify fabrics and minerals she knows with a cursory touch, and can hear at frequencies several times lower than a human.

She can listen clearly to conversations through thick stone walls, hear creatures burrowing in the ground, ants marching on the branches above her head, and other, similar feats.

She can perceive movement across surfaces she is touching, such as footsteps approaching her in a pitch black hallway.


### Master Plan Meditation
`Mind 8, Enabler`

Augment a Larceny roll to forge, counter-feit, prepare an alibi, collect information about someone, obtain maps of a target location, plan to enter or escape a dangerous location or plot to confuse or undermine law enforcement or criminal groups.

Any excess level on the roll become contingency points that can be spent to:
  * Retroactively distort or destroy a piece of evidence
  * Alter a piece of evidence to point to another person (2 points)
  * Gain a Scene-long asset to Integrity, Socialize or Performance.
  * Retroactively leave the Solar's calling card (mark, sign, etc.)
  * Other instances the player can say "I planned for this" and cackle evilly


### Guardian Fog Approach
`Mind 2 per ally, Enabler`

** Through quick action, the Solar may obscure her allies. **

This Charms allows the Solar's Stealth Roll and applicable Charms to apply to her allies.

For any ally so affected, the Roll's difficulty increases by 1, up to a maximum of (Tier) allies.

The allies must stay in very close proximity of the Lawgiver and use their Actions to follow her lead, and she must be trying to hide herself.


### Soaring Crane Leap
`2 Body, Enabler`

** It is the Solar’s nature to rise above. **

This Charm must be used before the Solar's Action and allows her to jump as part of that Action, multiplying the jumping distance by her (Tier + Athletics).

In this way, the Solar could leap to strike a flying enemy, or leap away to shot an arrow away from her enemy's reach.

Further, whether she's soaring up or falling down, the Solar gains limited control on her speed and direction; continuous use of the charm will allow her to avoid falling damage from any height.



## Tier 5


### ??? Nine Aeons Thew
`Body 12, Enabler`
Lift anything or break any object as long as you can grab it.
Breaking artifacts requires a roll.


### Eye of the Unconquered Sun
`Mind 10, Action`

** Solars are the legacy of the Unconquered Sun. It is their destiny to see the world through this age of darkness. **

The Solar Caste Mark blazes like a tiny sun (this effect cannot be muted by other Charms), making stealth impossible.

Eyes blazing white, her gaze shines a wide beam of light across everything she searches, twin lamps moving over the terrain out to long range.

Everything caught in her stare is subject to the following effects:
  * All magical and mundane Stealth effects are cancelled.
  * Solid walls and other opaque objects grow transparent as the Lawgiver’s gaze passes over them, rendering all forms of Stealth automatically unsuccessful.
  * Fog lifts, smoke parts, and clouds dissolve under the Solar’s intense focus.
  * Dematerialized spirits are forced to materialize, at full cost of the Materialize Charm, or as much of the cost as they can pay.
  * All disguise magic is stripped. Mundane disguises tatter and melt away.
  * Shapeshifters are forced back into natural form, resplendent destinies are temporarily forced into dormancy, Personas are suppressed, and other innate or native transformative magics of the Exalted are similarly deactivated.


### Split Deception Method / Flashing Ruse Prana
???
With a rending of air, the Solar sweeps away the mask she
once wore. This Charm supplements a disguise attempt
by reducing the time it takes from five minutes to instant.
When used in combination with another Larceny-based
disguise Charm, ignore the Willpower cost.

The Lawgiver walks through the valley of the wicked
wearing a thousand faces. This Charm allows the Exalt
to place a second disguise over the one she is wearing by
attempting a second disguise action per the rules on page
224. This attempt may be supplemented by disguise
Charms as usual. When she is seen wearing two or more
disguises, the player dictates which disguise each witness
sees. The Solar may sustain no more disguises than she
has dots of Essence.


### Vanishing From Mind’s Eye Method
** One of the greatest of all deceptions—the Solar vanishes from memory. **

Roll the Exalt’s (Dexterity + Stealth) and add her Essence in automatic successes to the result.
Record the result. The Exalt slips out of the thoughts and memories of everyone who has ever known her, hiding in their minds.
Upon meeting, she is unrecognizable to those who should know her.
Once per day, individuals affected by this Charm may attempt to recognize the Exalt or remember her involvement in a past event.

Roll the subject’s (Wits + Lore) against a difficulty equal to the Exalt’s result.
If the roll does not succeed, he does not recognize the Solar, and the Exalt remains a nameless, shadowy distortion in his memories.


## Tier 6


### ??? Speed of Light Approach
A Solar who dedicates herself to the principles of speed is as omnipresent as sunlight, and just as impossible to grasp. All of the character’s movement rates are doubled, as long as she is moving under her own power. More importantly, whenever the character takes a Move, Dash or Jump action, she vanishes into a blur, only to reappear at her destination. The Lawgiver is impossible to target while moving, unless the attacker succeeds on a reflexive (Perception + Awareness) roll against a Difficulty of (Solar’s Dexterity). The Solar may be targeted normally during any tick on which she takes an action other than to Move, Dash or Jump.
A second purchase of this Charm at Athletics 7+, Essence 7+ triples the character’s movement rates and causes any Move, Dash or Jump action she takes to count as an opportunity to re-establish surprise.


### Dream-Ending Gesture
???

Steal and re-attune attuned artifacts
Steal Essence

With a curt flash of her hand,
the Solar rips away the proof of her foe’s divinity. The
Exalt uses a gambit costing five Initiative, making a (Dex-
terity + Larceny) based decisive attack against her op-
ponent, with double successes on the Initiative roll. If
the Exalt’s gambit succeeds, she steals a number of motes
equal to her extra successes on the attack, adding them
to her peripheral or personal motes. Dream-Ending
Gesture can only be used once per scene.

Upon stealing an artifact,
she experiences a rush of power that surges through her
body and floods into her hands, supplying the motes
needed to attune the artifact, effectively reducing the
cost of attunement to 0. This may only happen once
per scene.


### Everywhere and Nowhere Stance
???
The eyes of the Solar Exalted are always watching. Through the use of this Charm, the Solar becomes omnipresent in the minds of the wicked. The Solar touches a target (this may require a Dexterity + Martial arts attack if the target attempts to avoid contact) and spends four motes. The sensation of the Solar’s touch lingers on and on, eventually spreading to encompass all of the target’s senses. So long as these motes remain committed, the Lawgiver seems to be constantly shadowing his mark—the target frequently glimpses the Solar leaning in doorways, or disappearing down alleys. He sees the Exalt’s silhouette watching him from rooftops or following him through crowds. The Solar seems to be watching more often than not, always vanishing if confronted directly.
This is an unnatural Illusion effect which costs two Willpower to ignore for a scene; the effects of the Charm end once the target has spent a total of twenty Willpower fighting it. The Lawgiver adds his Essence in bonus successes to all attempts to establish or re-establish surprise against individuals afflicted by Everywhere and Nowhere Stance—it becomes difficult to discern the Solar’s true presence from the shadows in the target’s mind.
A second purchase of this Charm at Stealth 6+, Essence 6+ permits the Solar to use this Charm on an area. Used in this manner, Everywhere and Nowhere Stance has a cost of 6m, 1wp. So long as the Solar commits Essence to the Charm, everyone in the affected region suffers visions of the Solar’s presence, as detailed above, though with lower frequency—no more than once per scene. Individuals in the affected region may resist the Charm’s Illusion for one Willpower per scene, but cannot permanently immunize themselves to it so long as they remain in the area. Everywhere and Nowhere Stance may initially be used upon an area a mile in diameter, but with Stealth 7+ the Solar may affect an area up to (Essence x 2) miles, and with Stealth 8+ may affect (Essence x 10) miles. At Stealth 9+ the Solar may spread her presence across (Essence x 100) miles, and with Stealth 10 the Lawgiver may encompass an entire Direction.
At Stealth 7+, Essence 7+, the Solar may add a point of permanent Willpower to the Charm’s cost when used to target a region. Doing so changes the Charm’s Duration to instant, requiring no Essence commitment on the part of the Lawgiver…and renders its effects permanent. The Solar’s shadows will continue to haunt the area forever, even after his own demise.



# Eclipse



## Tier 1


### Flawless Brush Discipline
`Mind 3, Enabler`

** The Solar concentrates all of her talent into a perfect expression of form. **

The Lawgiver writes with flawless precision at superhuman speed.

while composing a text, this charm allows her to refuse a GM intrusion related to the text.

The Lawgiver may perfectly copy any written work down to the finest detail, at ten times the speed.
Her flawless precision makes her script impossible to tell apart from the original, allowing her to create a perfect replica of a work.
If the Exalt focuses intently on aesthetic elements, she may even use this Charm to copy them, flawlessly reproducing pictograms, illustrations and even maps.
Magic which can detect the Solar’s forgery must overcome a difficulty equal to the Solar’s (Lore + Tier) score at the time of writing.

The charm creates its own ink or paint.


### Frugal Merchant Method
`Mind 3, Action`

Gives perfect knowledge of an item's quality and its current value in any market the Lawgiver is acquainted with.


### Mastery of Small Manners
`Mind 4, Enabler, Scene long`

** The Solar adapts to the expectations of the social and cultural context. **

The Solar ignores penalties for unfamiliarity with a social and cultural context and can refuse GM intrusions.

If she wants to do something, she will instinctively understand how to do it in a way that is appropriate or at least acceptable.


### Talking Between the Lines
`Mind 5, Enabler`

** Thus an Exalt using this Charm could appear to discuss the weather while laying out the details of an assassination plot. **

Hides a simple message in a speech or written text, so that only the intended recipient will be able to recognize it.



## Tier 2


### Excellent Sage's Discipline
`special`

Concentrating on a text, the Exalt can read it at superhuman speed and remember it perfectly.

She can read a scroll as quickly as she can unroll it, and a book as fast as she can turn the pages— approximately three pages per second.

Only the content of text, maps, tables and diagrams can be remembered, details about the medium can not.

Quick-reading a text costs (Mind 4).

Perfectly remembering a text requires the commitment of (Mind 1) per text; this can be used also to write entirely new texts entirely in the Exalt's mind.

After one season of frequent access, a remembered text is completely learned and the commitment cost can be released.


### Indolent Officier Prana
`Mind 5, Action`

Slow (or hasten) a single task undertaken by some bureaucracy by Tier degrees: Immediate > Minutes > Days > Weeks > Months > Seasons > Years > Decades > Centuries


### Irresistible Salesman Spirit
`Mind 3, Action`

On a successful Bureaucracy roll, target is convinced that something worthless is actually valuable or that something valuable is their heart's desire.


### Measuring Glance
`Mind 6, Action`

** The Solar can sum up the member of an organization with perfect incision. **

The Exalt can determine the opinion that a member of an organization holds of the same organization.

This Charm can be resisted only with magic; in this case the Lawgiver's Bureaucracy roll adds her Tier.


### Sagacious reading of intent
`Mind 8, Enabler`

This Charms enables the Solar to know the intent behind a text or statement, and whether it indicates anything that the author genuinely cares about.

If the words constitute a social attack, this Charm functions as a perfect defense against it.



## Tier 3


### Bureau-Reforming Kata
`Mind 6, Enabler`

** The Solar may use her bureaucratic prowess to reform an ailing or corrupt bureaucracy. **

The Lawgiver must participate in an investigation of the organization, attending or leading inquiries, reviewing records and interviewing involved parties.
For the duration of the inquest, add the Solar’s Bureaucracy to her Perception and Socialize rolls to conduct this investigation.

In addition, while this Charm is in effect, members of the organization will automatically perceive the Solar as a subject of confidential trust with regards to the bureau— someone they should both confide in and should speak truthfully to.

At the end of the inquiry, if the Lawgiver successfully uncovered evidence of any hostile magic, she instantly cleanse it.


### Golden Courtier Misdirection
`Mind 7, Enabler`

This is a perfect defense against attempts to read the character’s intentions, ideas or social qualities

The character decides what it is that people who attempt to discern these factors determine.


### Moving the Unseen Hand
`Mind 5, Enabler`

The Exalt pens a message in a hand so artful and deceptive that she can cause her reader to make an automatic assumption as to the writer’s identity, perfectly copying the writing voice of a character.

The Difficulty to pierce the deception is the Solar's (Lore + Tier) at the time of writing.

The Exalt may use this technique in four different ways:

  * She can make readers believe a message was written by a specific person of whom they’re aware—they do not need to know this character on a personal level.

  * She can also make readers assume the letter was written by the person they most want the letter to be from.

  * If the Solar is at least Trained in Bureaucracy, she can make readers assume the letter was written by a hierarchical superior.

  * She can simply sign the letter, in which case the deception will automatically succeed unless the target has reasons to suspect its origin or conent.



## Tier 4


### Infinitely-Efficient Register
[requires leading an organization and/or a system for long-term projects]


### Woe-Capturing Web
`Mind 5, Enabler`

Any time a magic is laid against an organization the Lawgiver belongs to, the GM gives her player the opportunity to activate this charm.

If the player does so, the Lawgiver will learn the rough effects of the magic, and reduce the Difficulty to remove or work around it by 2.

She can also inspect her immaculately-kept paperwork to discover information that she can use to profile and possibly identify the one whose magic has been snared.
To find the perpetrator's identity she needs to roll Bureaucracy against his Level.

If she is successful, she can immediately commit 1 Essence to trap the perpetrator's Pool used to fuel the magic, preventing him from relinquishing the curse before its normal duration has expired.


### Single Voice Kata
``

** There is a point in the infinite distance where purity and entropy touch. That point is both “before” and “after” but the Solar may reach it with a thought, to draw forth perfect language. **

While this Charm is active, the Solar speaks a language that can be understood by all who hear it.
Knowledge of this language is purely instinctual; characters understand the Solar’s words as she shapes them.
Her perfect language cannot be learned, as it has no intelligible words, letters or mechanics.
Consequently, it cannot be repeated back to the Solar such that she would comprehend it.
This Charm allows purely one way communications, imparting no knowledge of languages the Solar has not yet learned.
Spirits despise being addressed by a Solar using this Charm, and the Fair Folk feel physical pain to hear it spoken.
A Solar should only use this Charm against such beings if she deliberately intends to cause offense.



### Flashing Quill Atemi
Cost: 1m; Mins: Linguistics 5, Essence 3
Type: Reflexive
Keywords: Written-only
Duration: One minute
Prerequisite Charms: Power-Snaring Image
The Lawgiver strikes a body of text with her fingers, re-
shaping the language to serve her purposes. With this
Charm, the Solar may edit a manuscript, letter, or tome
with untraceable precision. Where she draws her finger-
tips through lines, words lift from pages as if they were
never written. Where she draws her fingertips through
runes, ink chases itself into the shapes of new words.
Through use of this Charm, the Solar can change the
targets of written social influence, and can redefine what
is intended by any social influence she encounters. Mod-
ifying a work encrypted with magic allows her to redirect
the targets of that magic. If she wishes to alter magic she
is incapable of producing, she must possess Essence 5+
and must use Power-Snaring Image in combination with
this Charm. This combination explicitly allows her to alter
magic for which she does not meet minimums.




## Tier 5

### Market Buster Strike
???

The Lawgiver may reward good citizens with wealth or ruin the unrighteous.

The player describes how the Lawgiver manipulates the value of a commodity or currency within a specific market, which generally takes one week of direct interaction.
Success requires a Bureaucracy roll against the highest level of any character who opposes her manipulations.


### Order-Conferring Advice
???


### Web-Cutting Eyes
`Mind 8, Action`

** The Solar’s cunning gaze cuts across all subtleties of motive and concealment, laying bare the intentions of those who stand before him. **

For one Scene, all the Lawgiver's attempts to read the motivation of other characters are rolled against Difficulty 1.



## Tier 6


### Halo of Ministerial Dominion
The Lawgiver subtly assumes the reins of power by creating temporary positions and laws to exploit.

The player describes how the Lawgiver seizes control of the organization, then rolls Bureaucracy against the level of the organization's leader.

If successful, the character will have five dots of Backing in a particular bureaucracy, though her official status remains unchanged.
The leader of the targeted bureaucratic organization may choose to block a successful activation by spending 5 Loyalty.
Doing so immunizes the organization against this Charm for one season.
???


### Twisted Words Technique

Concentrating on the formation of sounds and the weight of certain meanings, the Solar shapes her words like a weapon.
This Charm is a mental attack disguised as social influence, entailing a written or spoken action made with.

The Solar must target an Intimacy when using this Charm—exploiting something the character cares about to get him to accept influence.

However, upon success, the target will feel overwhelmingly compelled to act in a way that is the opposite of what she agreed to, as if her Intimacy had been inverted.

For example, a Solar convinces an Immaculate priest of the evils of the har-


### Mind-Swallowing Missive
???
The Solar unwinds language with her Essence, writing in such a way that it unbinds the pattern of her reader’s understanding.
This Charm supplements a letter written to a specific target, the Solar rolling (Manipulation + Linguistics) to determine its accuracy.
If her target reads the letter, he must roll his (Perception + Linguistics) to defend against a swarm of unbinding words that penetrates his mind where languages live.
If he fails, his knowledge of all languages is unbound, causing him to forget every language he’s currently able to speak.
In addition, the subject develops a completely new language on the spot.
This language is both functional and logical—and has letters and grammar mechanics—but it is known only to the Charm’s victim.
An Exalt may break this control by paying (Solar’s Essence rating) Willpower, instantly recovering one of his spoken languages and another every hour until his knowledge has been restored.
Otherwise, this effect lasts until the Solar lifts the commitment.
When Mind-Swallowing Missive is broken, the subject’s new language vanishes from his memory.
This Charm does not affect spirits.
The Lawgiver pens a soul-shattering missive, convicting her subject he leads a pointless existence.
This Charm can only be directed at a specific target.
If she beats her target’s Resolve, his soul falls off and sinks directly into lethe.
This Charm only targets characters who have unintelligibly abstruse Intimacies or no Intimacies at all; however, its effect depends on such an unfulfilled soul’s yearning for purpose and meaning—characters who are incapable of feeling (such as the soul-eaten victims of the Fair Folk) are not valid targets for this Charm.








## TODO?











### Essence-Laden Missive
The Exalt can infuse a short statement with Essence, such
that the Essence travels through the reader’s mind to
escape through his tongue. A character who reads such a
missive will immediately and unironically repeat the state-
ment he just read without realizing he’s doing so. This is
not a Charm which simply forces the character to read
aloud, but rather causes him to announce the missive. The
roll to determine whether the reader blurts out the missive
is treated as a ([Charisma or Manipulation] + Linguistics)
inspire action with (Essence) automatic successes.



### Voice-Caging Calligraphy
The Solar binds her words with Essence, folding language
into form so winding and deep that all meaning falls into
the abyss. This Charm may be used to supplement the
writing of letters or other brief works. The information
contained in such writing cannot be repeated. The reader
momentarily loses his ability to process or remember the
contents of the message if he tries to speak it aloud or
write it down. Any attempt by the reader to communicate
what he knows is rendered useless unless he sees an action
occurring in which a Defining Intimacy is threatened by
withholding what he knows. Only then may the reader
pay (Solar’s current Essence rating) Willpower to shake
off the effects of this Charm.
