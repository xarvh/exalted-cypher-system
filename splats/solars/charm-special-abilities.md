### Hungry Tiger Technique
`Body 3, Enabler, Attack Roll`

*The Solar charges her body and weapon with Essence, unifying the two to unleash a brutal strike that rends her opponent.*

Increases damage by 3, 5 or 7 for Light, Medium or Heavy weapons respectively.

As an alternative, the enemy is knocked down or away.


### Summoning the Loyal Steel
`Mind 1, Enabler`

*With a moment of concentration, the Solar may banish a weapon Elsewhere.*

Commit 1 Essence, instantly store or retrieve a weapon you own from Elsewhere.

* If the weapon is in line of sight, it can be called to her hand, and the Solar can't lose the weapon during combat.
* Prevents anyone else from re-attuning to the weapon.
* Reduces the Committed Essence cost of an attuned artifact weapon by half, round up.
* By paying 1 Essence, can be used to instantly create ammo for ranged weapons.


### War Lion Stance
`Body 4, Enabler`

*The Solar learns to defend others upon learning to defend herself.*

Pick someone within Short range. Every time they are attacked and the Solar has a weapon to parry the attack, she can make a Defense roll for them OR she can reduce the difficulty of their Defense roll by 1 if she is Trained or 2 if she is Specialised in the Skill she is using.

The Charm ends when the target leaves Short range.


## Tier 2


### Elegant Dance of Bow and Blade
`Body 2 per attack, Action`

The Solar can perform one attack with each weapon type (Light/Medium/Heavy, Melee/Ranged) she has at hand.

Each attack is rolled separately but Edges are applied only once.


### Heavenly Guardian Defense
`Body (special cost), Enabler, instant`

*The Anathema may strike aside even the falling sky.*

The Solar can parry *anything* physical, even if it's Unblockable, no roll required, and her weapon will take no damage.

The cost is equal to the level of the attack but can never exceed 10 points.

It can't be used more than once per combat turn.


### There is no Wind
`Body 2, Enabler`

*The Solar graces her shot with unerring precision and fires it along a flow of Essence, causing it to slice through the air between the arrow and its mark.*

In an Attack roll, ignore any Difficulty other than the target Level and cover (high winds, limited movement space, water, confetti, smoke...)


### Tiger Warrior Training Technique
`Enabler`

*Even the worst gutter-sweepings and bandits can be trained into an elite fighting force.*

In one week, turn an undisciplined military unit into average.

In one month, turn an average unit military unit into elite.

Any unit trained with this charm ignores penalties having to do with hunger, bad weather, long marches and mundane demoralizing effects.



## Tier 3


### Perfect Strike Discipline
`Enabler`

Can use again up to Max Effort levels of Effort above the normal Max Effort, but only to increase an attack's damage.


### Glorious Solar Saber (Action, Essence 6)
`Essence 5, Action`

*Honing her skill and focusing her will, the Exalt births a stunning weapon from her palm.*

Shape the Solar's essence into a weapon (or a weapon set where appropriate).
The weapon must be choosen when the Solar learns this Ability, and should be roughly equivaent to a (Tier + 4) level Artifact.
Additional weapons can be purchased for 3xp each.
Summoned weapons require no ammo.
The weapon lasts for one scene.


### Solar Counterattack
`Body 3, Enabler`

*The Exalt draws focus from her foe’s temerity. To strike her is to invite death.*

Before rolling a Parry, you can make an Attack to whoever is attacking you.

Damage is resolved simultaneously.


### Mist on Water Attack
`Body 2 per turn, Enabler`

*The Solar pours the cold instinct of her training into a blade, suffusing it with stifling Essence.*

A victim of this attack cannot produce sound.
He can neither cry out nor raise alarm, nor will his fist through a window produce the sound of shattered glass, nor will his body plummeting from the rooftops to the street make even the tiniest sound of thud
or splatter.
Characters thus affected may not be detected by any hearing-based Perception, and those who are killed will die in an unnoticeable fashion, determined by the GM: they may die standing up, reclining naturally, or their bodies may simply fall soundlessly out of sight.
In any case, the target’s death cannot be discovered until the effects of Mist on Water Attack have passed.



# Zenith


## Tier 1


### Iron-Kettle Body
`Enabler`

*Striking the Solar is like striking a piece of iron.*

The Solar's skin gives her Armor 2.

This bonus does not stack with worn Armor, but can stack with other sources of Armor.


### Respect-Commanding Attitude
`Mind 4, Action`

Forces people to stop and earnestly listen to what the Solar has to say.

The effect requires a roll only for those in the audience who'd rather attack.


### Righteous Lion Defense
`Enabler`

*Around a certain issue, the Solar cannot be moved, shaken, swayed or tempted.*

Upon purchasing this Charm, the player chooses a defining principle that exemplifies the Solar in such a way that she should never act against it.

The Solar becomes perfectly immune to any kind of influence which would cause the Solar to knowingly act against the principle.


### Soul-Firing Performance
`Mind 3, Action`
If successful, the group is struck with an emotion conveyed by the performance, and each affected target reconsiders a decision they made in his past, connected to that emotion.
The Storyteller chooses what each character is forced to reconsider.


### Spirit-Tied Pet
`Enabler`

*An Exalt with a familiar has experienced the gift of having been chosen twice.*

* No influence of any kind can make the familiar act against their loyalty for the Solar
* The familiar is protected against attacks and effects that do not target them directly
* The Exalt may borrow the sense of the familiar thought a moment of intense concentration.
  This renders the Solar incapable of taking any other action.


### Traceless Camouflage
`Mind 6, Enabler`

The Lawgiver can hide herself, her followers and objects up to the size of an elephant in any environment.

If standing in a place, they must spend time to camouflage:
  * 1 Action for one person
  * 1 minute for a handful of people
  * 1 hour for a large object
  * half a day for many people or objects

Once the camouflage is complete, they cannot be detected with mundane means.

If moving, they cannot be tracked with mundane means.

Against magical means, the Solar adds her Tier to the roll.



## Tier 2


### Fury-Inciting Speech
`Mind 5, Action`

The Solar speaks out against injustice, typically playing on local faith, tradition or morality, igniting anger in a crowd.

Requires a Presence roll; for every 2 excess levels, she can direct the crowd to attack a specific target.


### Hardship-Surviving Mendicant Spirit
`Body 5, Committed`

As long as some adversity originates from the normal features of the environment, including climate, flora and fauna, it will not harm or penalize the Solar.


### Integrity Protecting Prana
`Essence 5, Enabler, commitment`

Perfect immunity to Shaping effects as long as the motes are committed.

Can be activated even when incapacitated, sleeping or otherwise unconscious.


### Spirit-Tempering Practice
`Enabler`

The Solar can take a Recovery under a duress regime (torture, interrogation) or fatiguing activity that lasts at least as long as the Recovery.

Doing so also automatically resists the duress and overcomes the fatigue.


### Unbreakable Warrior’s Mastery
`Body 5, Enabler`

*The Lawgiver knows all harm at once, and yet the greater truth is that she still exists, unbowed and unbroken.*

This charms lessens physical crippling effects.

Temporary penalties are halved, rounding down, and their duration cannot exceed (4 - Resitance) actions.

Irreparable or permanent harm can be traded for a lesser effect of a shorter duration: instead of her eye being gouged out, it is closed by a glancing blow; instead of her arm being shattered, it simply hangs limp.


### Underling-Promoting Touch
`Essence 3, Action`

*With a touch, the Exalt raises a servant to the role of a champion.*

By touching a person who serves or follows her, the Lawgiver temporarily makes her subject the beneficiary of respect and admiration usually reserved for the Solar.

Characters who have ties of loyalty, respect or admiration to the Solar now also feel the same way toward her charge.

The character also inherits any social station or role it is within the Solar’s right to grant, and all characters who are subject to that station instantly recognize that they are subject to the promoted one’s authority.

The target gains an Essence pool equal to the Solar's (Presence x2) and becomes inured to supernatural terror, resisting it with a +2 bonus.



## Tier 3


### Adamant Skin Technique
`Body 5, Enabler, instant`

*Driven by purpose, the Solar refuses to be defeated.*

This Charm is activated on taking damage to her Body Pool and can be used even in case of a surprise attack: the Solar rolls Resistence, removing the result from the damage.

As an alternative, the Charm grants total immunity to scenery-based damage, like that of an explosion or a collapse, or falling from a great height.


### Life-Sustaining Shelter Preparation
`Essence 8, long Action`

*The Solar Exalted may survive anywhere.*

Once she has found an area large enough to protect all of her followers, the Solar places representations of the five elements at the center and directional boundaries of the area, which can be actual examples of each element, such as twigs, stone, cinders, etc, or the Solar may use a few drops of blood, paper effigies, Dragon-Blooded willing to sit still or other tokens.
Doing so blesses the area with her essence, claiming it as her dominion and making it Holy.

All individuals within the shelter are treated as if under the effect of Hardship-Surviving Mendicant Spirit and the shelter itself is immune to the inclement conditions of the environment: the Wyld will not mutate the camp’s land, the Solar’s followers, or their belongings, nor will Malfeas’s toxic miasma poison them.
The Solar and her followers may respire Essence normally even in the Underworld or the Blight Zones of Autochthonia.

The Solar’s followers will take no harm from any nourishment scavenged within the confines of the shelter: Wyld berries will not poison them, nor singing fish give them mutations, the iridescent locusts which swarm across the sands of Cecelyne will not infect them with demonic taint.
The shelter confines will provide enough food to feed all the Solar's followers even if there no food: as if produced by faith alone, the Solar finds clean water flowing from the rocks of Malfeas, fresh fish in the acrid seas of Kimbery, and living fruit upon dead branches.


### Majestic Radiant Presence
`Enabler`

*The Lawgiver is a singular and terrifying being, awesome to behold.*

The Solar gains +2 bonus to any intimidation roll.

Anyone wishing to initiate combat or speak against her must overcome this fear effect, whether the Solar is aware of them or not.

A character that overcomes this effect will be immune to it for the rest of the Scene.


### Memory-Reweaving Discipline
`Mind 6, Enabler`

*The Exalt weaves a narrative so plausible and compelling that those who hear it forget the truth and believe the narrative.*

The Solar speaks for at least a minute, though more complex narratives may require longer.
Mere success entails a simple belief in the facts as the Solar has presented them.
Extra successes, however, increase commitment to this belief.


### Truth Shines Through
`Enabler`

*The virtue of the Lawgivers is like the sun at noon. Clouds might obscure it, but its light can never truly be banished or denied.*

Whenever the Solar act under some unnatural mental influence, the fact that she is not behaving like herself becomes obvious to all the observers.



## Tier 4


### Destiny-Manifesting Method
`Enabler`

*The Solar is the heritor of a legend that cannot easily be erased.*

When struck with a reality-shaping or fate-weaving attack that would permanently alter her mind or body, the Solar’s destiny manifests to override the changes.
This Charm does not completely nullify deleterious effects, but downgrades or slows them such that two things are guaranteed:
  1. the Solar cannot be immediately changed beyond her ability to represent the character concept implied by her Caste and Focus [is this flexible/good enough?].
  2. no matter how fatal or permanent the effect may be, fate itself will generate a condition by which the Solar may shatter any curse.

Once the condition is shattered once, it cannot affect the Solar again, applying a minimal penalty for an action or paltry damage at worst.


### Heart-Compelling Method
`Mind 3, Action`

*The Lawgiver’s music pulls at the soul of her target, impelling him to act on his deepest desires.*

The Solar performs for at least a minute, declaring an emotion that she wants to arouse in her audience.

The Solar doesn't need to know her audience: the performance will automatically revive the audience memories and experiences that are more likely to lead to the intended emotion.

The emotion will be aroused automatically, even if the audience is hostile.

On a successful Performance Roll however, the audience will feel strongly compelled to act on the emotion, if not immediately very soon.


### Mind-Blanking Rebuke
`Mind 6, Action`

*The Lawgiver issues a powerful admonition against a target, forbidding him from taking a certain action.*

Social attack, prevents a target from taking a certain specific action (usually the purview of a single Mundane Ability) for the rest of the Scene.

Examples of actions that are valid targets include "dodging my attacks" "attacking me with your daiklave" "picking any locks" or "using Seven Shadow Evasion."

The Lawgiver cannot prevent the target from resisting Mind-Blanking Rebuke, or forbid any necessary life function ("do not breathe" is not a valid ban).


### Bloodthirsty Sword-Dancer Spirit
`Mind 1, Enabler`

*The Solar drops to a deeper level of consciousness, sinking into a meditation on violence and destruction.*

In this fugue state, the Lawgiver's world narrows to a tight red tunnel with things that must die at the far end.

In this state, she is immune to penalties due to pain, crippling effects or zeroed pools.

Whenever the Lawgiver rolls to close the distance or kill an enemy:
* Her Body Edge is raised by 3
* Her roll gains a +2

Whenever she tries to do *anything* else, she needs to spend 3 points of Mind.

In this state the Solar cannot be safely dissuaded from combat.
Should friends or allies choose to stand in her way, she won’t slaughter them unheedingly, but will use any force necessary to remove them from her path so she can continue to assault her original target.

She will not, and cannot end her assault until her targets are dead or fled, and if she is convinced by an impassioned plea to drop her commitment to this Charm, she suffers Mind damage equal to her Tier x2.



# Twilight


## Tier 1


### Anointment of Miraculous Health
`Mind 4, Action`

*Disease and debilitation cannot stand against the Solars’ healing light.*

The Solar spends about one hour, depending on the condition, treating her patient for a single condition, be it sickness, disease or poison, whether mundane or supernatural.
The severity of the condition is reduced by (Medicine) Levels.
The charm can be used again at every interval that the condition requires the patient to roll Resistance.

At Tier 2+ the Solar can heal permanent or congenital conditions, treat it like a Crafting Project whose Assessed Difficulty is reduced again by the Solar's Medicine.
For example, regrowing a lost limb would have an Assessed Difficulty of 7.


### Craftsman Needs No Tools
`Mind 6, Enabler, Scene long`

The Solar can use her body, breath and voice instead of tools.
+1 to Craft.


### Crafty Observation Method
`Mind 4, Action`

*When the Lawgiver inquires, Creation immediately yields its secrets bare.*

The Lawgiver concentrates on the scene she is surveying, exposing the very essence of all the objects around her.
In her mind furniture moves, carpets lift, drawers open, books flip their pages.
In a single action she can complete a search that would take 15 minutes, and she doesn't actually touch or move anything.
Further, she adds her Tier to notice deliberate tampering with any evidence.
If the scene contains at least one lead for the Solar's inquiry, she is guaranteed to find it.

She cannot search objects that she could not normally access such as locked chests or items held by people who are not willing to let her search them.

By committing 1 Mind, she can perfectly recall the whole scene survey.


### Shape Terrestrial Sorcery
`Mind 3, Action`

Allows to use Terrestrial Sorcery. Requires being Trained in Occult.


### Spirit-Manifesting Word
`Mind 5, Action`

*The Lawgiver rends the veil with word and voice, giving physical form to immaterial spirit.*

The Solar speaks an unutterable word and rolls (Occult + Tier); any spirit whose Level is below the roll and who is in range of the Solar's voice becomes materialized.
Spirits such materialized cannot dematerializes until the end of the Scene or until the Solar releases them.


### Wyld-Dispelling Prana
`Mind 6, Enabler, 1+ Actions`

*The Lawgiver is the embodiment of order. With her knowledge and will, chaos is cast asunder.*

Roll (Lore + 2) to repel a Wyld Shaping effect happening withing Short Range.

For any excess levels in the roll, the target is immune to Wyld warping for one turn.



## Tier 2


### All-Encompassing Sorcerer's Sight
`Mind 6, Enabler`

*The Exalt gazes into the Essence of the world and sees the patterns of magic that make up Creation.*

For a few seconds after activating this Charm, the Solar can see Essence flowing through the world.
She can perceive immaterial spirits, but moreover, she can see the workings of spirit energies around her.
If a character is using a Shaping action or Evocation, the Solar may make an Occult Roll to determine how the power works.
This Charm may also be used to identify the presence of ongoing sorcerous effects such as mystical barriers and levitating platforms, revealing not only the presence of magic, but how it functions.
This power also allows the Exalt to see places where Creation is thin—the borders of shadow-lands and the Wyld appear as hazy, gauzy distortions of light.
The Solar may also detect the entrance to spirit sanctums within her range of vision.
This Charm does not reveal the working of the Charms of the Exalted.


### Contagion-Curing Touch
`Enabler`

*Where the Exalt’s Essence-charged hands go, shattered bones are made whole and torn flesh is instantly mended.*

The Solar can spend Body instead of Mind to fuel any healing Charm as well as Effort for Medicine Rolls.

She can replace the need for surgical tools or medicines by spending Essence equal to the Level of the condition she's treating.


### Durability-Enhancing Techinque
`Mind 5, Enabler, Scene long` or `Mind 5, Extended Action, Permanent`

Increase the difficulty to damage an object of up to `Tier + 2` radius by Tier + 2.

The object is also protected from Shaping effects, but this protection will last a maximum of Tier days.

If the Solar holds the object, mundane effects cannot break it.


### Irresistible Questioning Technique
`Mind 5, Action`

*The Lawgiver may wring the truth from a subject with piercing, impossible-to-resist questions.*

The Lawgiver asks a question and the target is compelled to answer.

If the target uses an appropriate supernatural mental defense, leaves the scene or attacks her, then the Solar needs to roll Presence + Tier.
Otherwise, the success is automatic and no roll is required.

In case of success, the target is compelled to answer truthfully and to the fullest extent of his knowledge.


### Legendary Scholar's Curriculum
`Enabler`

*The Lawgiver is a master instructor, capable of passing on truths and talents as surely as the sun passes daylight.*

Upon learning this Charm the Solar prepares a curriculum that will allow her to teach one of the following Mundane Abilities:
  * Bureaucracy
  * Craft
  * Integrity
  * Larceny
  * Lore
  * Medicine
  * Occult
  * Socialize
  * War

Additional Abilities from the list can be purchased for 1 XPs.

After teaching for one week, the students are considered Trained in the choosen Ability and will develop an attachment to an idea that the Solar holds.

After teaching for one additional month, the students are considered Specialised in the choosen Ability and will develop an attachment to an idea that the Solar wants to impart.

This teaching is so effective that the Solar can ignore all penalties to teach a willing student: she can educate a person who is deemed medically incapable of learning, such as someone who is developmentally disabled, or someone who has suffered traumatic injury or privation by the Fair Folk.

Further, the Solar can disguise subversive or dangerous lessons as something they are not: the Lawgiver might appear to be giving a lesson on Immaculate catechisms while actually training
itinerants to resist the Realm; a lesson on eroticism might hide insights into demonology.
Only the targets of the Solar’s training can understand the true meaning of her lesson.


### Wholeness-Restoring Meditation
`Mind 10, Action, extended`

Heal permanent or congenital conditions through repeated treatment.

Depending on the severity of the condition, treatment can take from 1 hour to 1 month.



## Tier 3


### Empathic Recall Discipline
`WORK IN PROGRESS`
* see a scene from the perspective of one of the partecipants
* understand the intention of a perpetrator after surveying a scene


### Perfect Celestial Chirurgeon
`Mind 6, Action`

*With superhuman focus the Solar concentrates on her medical knowledge to save lives, making her every movement and action flawless.*

The Solar visits her patient to diagnose his condition, rolling Medicine: on a success, she perfectly diagnoses and recognizes the condition, its origin and its exact effects.
She will add her Tier on any Medicine roll to treat the condition and will receive a free Player Intrusion on any GM Intrusion related to the condition.
The success is automatic on any condition that the Solar has already successfully treated.

On a failure, the information she gathers will still be perfectly reliable, but more limited in extent, giving her at least a general idea of the nature and effects of the condition.

The Charm can be used multiple times to diagnose multiple conditions, starting from the highest-Level one.


### Shape Celestial Sorcery
`Mind 5, Action`

Allows to use Celestial Sorcery. Requires knowing Shape Terrestrial Sorcery.


### Wonder-Forging Genius
`Enabler`

*Through intense cultivation of the self, the Lawgiver shatters the boundaries of her own creativity.*

Max Effort for all Craft rolls is increased by (Craft x2).


### Wyld-Shaping Technique
`12 Essence, 10 Mind, 1 XP, Action`

*Of all the Chosen, the Solar Exalted alone have the power to stem the tides of chaos with their force of will.*

This Charm represents a Solar whose mind flows with a command of knowledge so potent it can reverse the decay of Creation.
Channeling endless lore through unsurpassed Essence, the Solar stands at the edge of the world and forces shape into the howling teeth of the storm.

Through use of this Charm, the Solar can fashion the raw forces of chaos into practically anything—so long as her mind is able to conceptualize the reality of her desire and force it to take shape.

See [wyld-shaping.md](Wyld Shaping) for details.



# Night



## Tier 1


### Flawless Pickpocketing Technique
`Mind 3, Action`

*With hands quicker than the eye, the Exalt relieves a hapless soul of his material burden.*

Automatically succeed on a mundane pickpocketing attempt.

Gives +3 when contested with magic.

Cannot be used to pick items in use or attuned artifacts.


### Graceful Crane Stance
`Permanent`

*The Solar is as graceful as sunlight on water.*

The Solar has Perfect balance: she can stand or run on things normally too weak or narrow, with no chance of falling or breaking through.

She can run on a guy wire, stand on a crumbling parapet, balance on the tip of a pine tree, and perform many similar feats without needing to roll for her balance.


### Invisible Statue Spirit
`Mind 5, Action to initiate`

*Assuming perfect stillness, the Solar fades from sight.*

A Solar with this Charm can affect true invisibility.
However, the Exalt cannot move, nor can she take violent action without breaking this deception.

Characters using Invisible Statue Spirit are not immaterial and can still be detected by touch, scent, taste but not hearing.


### Lock-Opening Touch
`Mind 4, Action`

Open any lock mechanism.

Mundane locks are opened automatically, no Roll or lockpicking tools are required.

Magical locks require a (Larceny + Tier) Roll: on a failure the lock is opened but a GM Intrusion occours.


### Shadow Over Water
`Body 2, Enabler`

Reduces the Difficulty of a Dodge roll by 2, can be used *after* the die has been cast.

Edges apply as if the Charm was used together with the Dodge roll.


### Surprise Anticipation Method
`Enabler`

*The Solar’s senses guard her from threats she is not consciously aware of.*

Whenever the Solar is in danger, due to a hidden enemy, a trap or any source of harm not readily apparent, she will know that something is off.

In order to reveal the actual nature of the threat, she will still need to roll Perception, but she can pay 1 point less per level of Effort.

Her senses will function even when she is asleep or knocked out or otherwise unconscious: if she successfully detects the threat, she will instantly revive to try and defend herself.



# Tier 2


### Easily-Overlooked Presence Method
`Mind 6, Enabler, Scene long`

*Even amidst the Imperial Treasury, the Lawgiver projects her right to be there.*

As long as the Solar does not stand out, her presence there will slip away from any onlooker's mind, like an irrelevant extra.

Things that usually will count as "standing out" are taking overt action, attacking and general displays of prowess: leaping from the street to the rooftops, braving a snowstorm in summer clothes, etc.

If she is dressed and behaving as expected for the present circumstances, those that interact with her by matter of routine won't find her suspicious.

Even if she was caught somewhere she doesn't belong, she will immediately become aware of a gap in her inquisitor’s knowledge she can exploit: stopped at a picket, she realizes the soldier questioning her is expecting a messenger he has never seen; confronted by a tenant when creeping through the glass towers of Chiaroscuro, she realizes there are vacant rooms and assumes the role of a squatter.


### Flawlessly Impenetrable Disguise
`Mind 5, Action, Scene long`

*Master chameleons, the Solars donned disguises and attended the fetes of the raksha, to hear them confess their nefarious plans for Creation.*

The Solar can don a different gender, etnicity, voice, accent, scent, as well as double or halve her age, increase or decrease height by up to 25cm, creating a completely new appearance or impersonating someone specific.

Identity is Perfectly disguised, deception can be detected only with magic means (roll Larceny + Tier to contest).

Characters are not entitled to attempt to see through the disguise unless the Solar behaves in a grossly inaccurate way.

Setting up the disguise takes about 5 minutes.

At Tier 4, she can even mock the features of magical beings: her hair might stand on end and crackle with lightning; she might hover inches off the ground or display the anima of a different kind of Exalt.
None of these displays are real: displaying a Fire Aspect’s anima will not actually burn anything, though witnesses will feel the intensity of its heat.
She may appear to float, but her feet are still touching the ground.


### Keen Sight Technique
`Mind 8, Enabler, Scene long`

*The Lawgiver's visual acuity transcends mortal limits.*

* +Tier to notice hidden persons or devices, to catch sleight of hand and see through disguises.

* In dim conditions, the Lawgiver sees as well as in broad daylight.

* Reduce the penalties due to environmental visual hindrances such as dense smoke or fog by 2: these effects reflect the Exalt’s ability to notice and process hundreds of minute details, as well as to focus and manage light sources more effectively.

* She can resolve tiny details at distance.

* She can quickly estimate distances, sizes and numbers on sight, for example to count enemy troops, dropped coins.


### Lightning-Hand Sleight

*Long ago, the Solars stole the implements of their virtue from beneath the gaze of the gods’ own masters.*

Between breaths, eyeblinks, even thoughts, the Exalt’s hands flash out.

This Charm is used to perform a sleight of hand in plain sight as if every onlooker was momentarily distracted.

Further, the change cannot be noticed for (Larceny + Tier) minutes unless the circumstances call attention to it, such as a soldier attempting to draw his stolen blade.


### Seven Shadows Evasion
`Mind 2 and Body (special cost), Enabler, instant`

*The Solar’s perfect form is quicker than an eyeblink and more tractile than water.*

The Solar can dodge *anything* physical, even if it's Undodgeable, no roll required.

The Body cost is equal to the level of the attack but can never exceed 8 points.


### Ten Aurochs Meditation
`Body 3, Enabler`

This Charm increases the effects of using Effort for a single action or task where raw strength matters.

Any level of Effort used for feats of strength (usually lifting or breaking stuff) is multiplied by the Solar's Athletics.

If an attack damage can be affected by the Solar's strength, then each level of Effort will increase the damage by (3 + Athletics).



## Tier 3


### Keen Taste and Smell Technique + Foe Scenting Method
`Mind 8, Enabler, Scene long`

*The Exalt’s senses of taste and smell are capable of flawless identification of flavors, textures, and scent profiles.*

The Solar perfectly remembers all the scents and flavours she has experienced and will automatically recognize them when this Charm is active.

She can identify obscure, complex, or similar flavors and she can deconstruct a meal she has eaten to its basic ingredients, so long as she has experienced most of the flavors at some point in time.

She has +2 to Survival Rolls to hunt for food, track a character, or find water using her sense of smell.

She can recognize an individual by scent alone and tell older scents from new ones, enabling her to tell how recently an individual was present; even if a scent is not known to her, she can make generally accurate discernments about what kind of being a scent belongs to: beasts, for example, smell different than humans, as do the undead and spirits.

At Tier 3+ she can smell dematerialized spirits.


### Perfect Shadow Stillness
`Essence 3, Enabler`

*The Lawgiver’s stealth technique is honed until it’s flawless.*

After a failure or GM Intrusion on a Stealth Roll, the player gets a free Player Intrusion.


### Proof-Eating Palm
`Mind 3, Action`

*The Solar’s genius hands can outwit even the sharpest eye.*

This Charm allows her to hide any object small enough to palm.
She may appear to swallow the item, fit it under her tongue, hide it up her sleeve, etc. The object vanishes.
When the Exalt needs it again she may will it into her hand with just a thought.
The Exalt may hide no more than (Larceny x2) objects, but each object must be hidden in a separate space.


### Racing the Sun
`2 Body, Enabler`

*Attuned to Essence currents that flow through the world, the Solar moves as if in a waking dream.*

Multiply running speed by (Tier + Athletics) for a single Action.
During a chase, add Tier to any roll to outrun an opponent.
Lasts for a single Action.


### Safety Between Heartbeats
`Body 1, Enabler`

*In making herself untouchable, the Lawgiver exploits the slightest hesitation, even the pause to draw breath, maximizing her opponent’s failure.*

This Charm enhances a roll to Dodge an attack.
Whether the roll is successful or not, the attacker's next action suffers a penalty equal to the Solar's Athletics.



## Tier 4


### Flow Like Blood
`Body 8, Action`

*Essence permeates the Lawgiver’s being. She moves with an unnatural fluid grace.*

For the rest of the Scene, any Dodge roll benefits from the full Max Effort without cost.


### Hundred Shadow Ways
`Body 6, Enabler`

After successfully dodging an attack, the Exalt may activate this Charm to counter up to (Athletics) Charms used in the attack.

For the remainder of the Scene, the effects of the countered Charms do not apply to her or to attacks against her.

The Charm ends automatically if any GM intrusion happens on any Dodge roll.

The Charm can be used as many times in the same Scene as the character Pools can afford.


### Keen Hearing and Touch Technique
`Mind 8, Enabler, Scene long`

*The Lawgiver listens with the intensity of an owl, and feels movement in the world like a spider feels a touch against its web.*

Perception is counted twice on Rolls that are based on hearing or touch.

The Exalt may identify fabrics and minerals she knows with a cursory touch, and can hear at frequencies several times lower than a human.

She can listen clearly to conversations through thick stone walls, hear creatures burrowing in the ground, ants marching on the branches above her head, and other, similar feats.

She can perceive movement across surfaces she is touching, such as footsteps approaching her in a pitch black hallway.


### Master Plan Meditation
`Mind 8, Enabler`

Augment a Larceny roll to forge, counter-feit, prepare an alibi, collect information about someone, obtain maps of a target location, plan to enter or escape a dangerous location or plot to confuse or undermine law enforcement or criminal groups.

Any excess level on the roll become contingency points that can be spent to:
  * Retroactively distort or destroy a piece of evidence
  * Alter a piece of evidence to point to another person (2 points)
  * Gain a Scene-long +1 to Integrity, Socialize or Performance.
  * Retroactively leave the Solar's calling card (mark, sign, etc.)
  * Other instances the player can say "I planned for this" and cackle evilly


### Guardian Fog Approach
`Mind 2 per ally, Enabler`

*Through quick action, the Solar may obscure her allies.*

This Charms allows the Solar's Stealth Roll and applicable Charms to apply to her allies.

For any ally so affected, the Roll's difficulty increases by 1, up to a maximum of (Tier) allies.

The allies must stay in very close proximity of the Lawgiver and use their Actions to follow her lead, and she must be trying to hide herself.


### Soaring Crane Leap
`2 Body, Enabler`

*It is the Solar’s nature to rise above.*

This Charm must be used before the Solar's Action and allows her to jump as part of that Action, multiplying the jumping distance by her (Tier + Athletics).

In this way, the Solar could leap to strike a flying enemy, or leap away to shot an arrow away from her enemy's reach.

Further, whether she's soaring up or falling down, the Solar gains limited control on her speed and direction; continuous use of the charm will allow her to avoid falling damage from any height.

## Tier 1


### Flawless Brush Discipline
`Mind 3, Enabler`

*The Solar concentrates all of her talent into a perfect expression of form.*

The Lawgiver writes with flawless precision at superhuman speed.

while composing a text, this charm allows her to refuse a GM intrusion related to the text.

The Lawgiver may perfectly copy any written work down to the finest detail, at ten times the speed.
Her flawless precision makes her script impossible to tell apart from the original, allowing her to create a perfect replica of a work.
If the Exalt focuses intently on aesthetic elements, she may even use this Charm to copy them, flawlessly reproducing pictograms, illustrations and even maps.
Magic which can detect the Solar’s forgery must overcome a difficulty equal to the Solar’s (Lore + Tier) score at the time of writing.

The charm creates its own ink or paint.


### Frugal Merchant Method
`Mind 3, Action`

Gives perfect knowledge of an item's quality and its current value in any market the Lawgiver is acquainted with.


### Mastery of Small Manners
`Mind 4, Enabler, Scene long`

*The Solar adapts to the expectations of the social and cultural context.*

The Solar ignores penalties for unfamiliarity with a social and cultural context and can refuse GM intrusions.

If she wants to do something, she will instinctively understand how to do it in a way that is appropriate or at least acceptable.


### Talking Between the Lines
`Mind 5, Enabler`

*Thus an Exalt using this Charm could appear to discuss the weather while laying out the details of an assassination plot.*

Hides a simple message in a speech or written text, so that only the intended recipient will be able to recognize it.



## Tier 2


### Excellent Sage's Discipline
`special`

Concentrating on a text, the Exalt can read it at superhuman speed and remember it perfectly.

She can read a scroll as quickly as she can unroll it, and a book as fast as she can turn the pages— approximately three pages per second.

Only the content of text, maps, tables and diagrams can be remembered, details about the medium can not.

Quick-reading a text costs (Mind 4).

Perfectly remembering a text requires the commitment of (Mind 1) per text; this can be used also to write entirely new texts entirely in the Exalt's mind.

After one season of frequent access, a remembered text is completely learned and the commitment cost can be released.


### Indolent Officier Prana
`Mind 5, Action`

Slow (or hasten) a single task undertaken by some bureaucracy by Tier degrees: Immediate > Minutes > Days > Weeks > Months > Seasons > Years > Decades > Centuries


### Irresistible Salesman Spirit
`Mind 3, Action`

On a successful Bureaucracy roll, target is convinced that something worthless is actually valuable or that something valuable is their heart's desire.


### Measuring Glance
`Mind 6, Action`

*The Solar can sum up the member of an organization with perfect incision.*

The Exalt can determine the opinion that a member of an organization holds of the same organization.

This Charm can be resisted only with magic; in this case the Lawgiver's Bureaucracy roll adds her Tier.


### Sagacious reading of intent
`Mind 8, Enabler`

This Charms enables the Solar to know the intent behind a text or statement, and whether it indicates anything that the author genuinely cares about.

If the words constitute a social attack, this Charm functions as a perfect defense against it.



## Tier 3


### Bureau-Reforming Kata
`Mind 6, Enabler`

*The Solar may use her bureaucratic prowess to reform an ailing or corrupt bureaucracy.*

The Lawgiver must participate in an investigation of the organization, attending or leading inquiries, reviewing records and interviewing involved parties.
For the duration of the inquest, add the Solar’s Bureaucracy to her Perception and Socialize rolls to conduct this investigation.

In addition, while this Charm is in effect, members of the organization will automatically perceive the Solar as a subject of confidential trust with regards to the bureau— someone they should both confide in and should speak truthfully to.

At the end of the inquiry, if the Lawgiver successfully uncovered evidence of any hostile magic, she instantly cleanse it.


### Golden Courtier Misdirection
`Mind 7, Enabler`

This is a perfect defense against attempts to read the character’s intentions, ideas or social qualities

The character decides what it is that people who attempt to discern these factors determine.


### Invincible Solar Vessel
`Essence 5, Action`

The Lawgiver commits her Essence to a particular vessel or vehicle, making it visibly blaze with the glory of the Unconquered Sun.

For as long as the Essence is committed, it acts as an extension of the Lawgiver's body.

The vessel benefits from all the defensive Charms the Lawgiver activates: if she is immune to Shaping effects, so will be the vessel; if invoking a Charm would protect her from being knocked down, the same Charm can be invoked to prevent the vessel from capsizing.

Further, the vessel can be controlled without need for a crew: lanyards untie themselves, sails raise and lower in accordance to the Lawgiver’s will, and the ship obediently tends to its own upkeep and operation.

So long as the Solar remains within Long Range of the ship, she may direct its course as though she were onboard.


### Moving the Unseen Hand
`Mind 5, Enabler`

The Exalt pens a message in a hand so artful and deceptive that she can cause her reader to make an automatic assumption as to the writer’s identity, perfectly copying the writing voice of a character.

The Difficulty to pierce the deception is the Solar's (Lore + Tier) at the time of writing.

The Exalt may use this technique in four different ways:

  * She can make readers believe a message was written by a specific person of whom they’re aware—they do not need to know this character on a personal level.

  * She can also make readers assume the letter was written by the person they most want the letter to be from.

  * If the Solar is at least Trained in Bureaucracy, she can make readers assume the letter was written by a hierarchical superior.

  * She can simply sign the letter, in which case the deception will automatically succeed unless the target has reasons to suspect its origin or conent.



## Tier 4


### Flag of All Nations Method
`Mind 6, Action`

*The authority of the Lawgivers transcends boundaries. All nations are their nations; all people are their people.*

The Lawgiver designs an insignia for a specific travelling group or vessel and a specific journey.

As long as the travelling group or vessel displays the insigna, anyone spotting them will assume they are allies, regardless of their appearance.

People who have *specific* suspicions about the behaviour of the group or the identity of some member of the group can contest the effect with Investigation vs the Lawgiver's Bureaucracy.


### Flashing Quill Atemi
`Mind 6, Action`

The Lawgiver strikes a body of text with her fingers, reshaping the language to serve her purposes.

With this Charm, the Solar may edit a manuscript, letter, or tome with untraceable precision.

Where she draws her fingertips through lines, words lift from pages as if they were never written.

Where she draws her fingertips through runes, ink chases itself into the shapes of new words.

Through use of this Charm, the Solar can change the targets of written social influence, and can redefine what is intended by any social influence she encounters.

Modifying a work encrypted with magic allows her to redirect the targets of that magic.

If she wishes to alter magic she is incapable of producing, she must possess Essence 5+ and must use Power-Snaring Image in combination with this Charm.

This combination explicitly allows her to alter magic for which she does not meet minimums.


### Infinitely-Efficient Register
[requires leading an organization and/or a system for long-term projects]


### Single Voice Kata
`Mind 4, Enabler`

[This feels like a nice gimmick, but no more than that =| ]

*There is a point in the infinite distance where purity and entropy touch. That point is both “before” and “after” but the Solar may reach it with a thought, to draw forth perfect language.*

While this Charm is active, the Solar speaks a language that can be understood by all who hear it.

Knowledge of this language is purely instinctual; characters understand the Solar’s words as she shapes them.

Her perfect language cannot be learned, as it has no intelligible words, letters or mechanics.

Consequently, it cannot be repeated back to the Solar such that she would comprehend it.

This Charm allows purely one way communications, imparting no knowledge of languages the Solar has not yet learned.

Spirits despise being addressed by a Solar using this Charm, and the Fair Folk feel physical pain to hear it spoken.

A Solar should only use this Charm against such beings if she deliberately intends to cause offense.


### Woe-Capturing Web
`Mind 5, Enabler`

Any time a magic is laid against an organization the Lawgiver belongs to, the GM gives her player the opportunity to activate this charm.

If the player does so, the Lawgiver will learn the rough effects of the magic, and reduce the Difficulty to remove or work around it by 2.

She can also inspect her immaculately-kept paperwork to discover information that she can use to profile and possibly identify the one whose magic has been snared.
To find the perpetrator's identity she needs to roll Bureaucracy against his Level.

If she is successful, she can immediately commit 1 Essence to trap the perpetrator's Pool used to fuel the magic, preventing him from relinquishing the curse before its normal duration has expired.
