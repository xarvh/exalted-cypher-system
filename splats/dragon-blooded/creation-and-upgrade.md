By spending 1 Essence a Dragon Blooded can perform minor manipulations of her Element: cooling herself with a light breeze, igniting a fire without flint or tinder, causing a flower to blossom early at her touch.

These never carry mechanical effects, but provide minor utility and can be incorporated into stunts.

For each Tier, the Dragon Blooded has the following upgrades:
  * Increase Max Effort by 1

  * Add an Option

They can also swap one Option for another of same or lower Tier.
