Special Abilities
=================

By spending 1 Essence a Dragon Blooded can perform minor manipulations of her Element: cooling herself with a light breeze, igniting a fire without flint or tinder, causing a flower to blossom early at her touch.

These never carry mechanical effects, but provide minor utility and can be incorporated into stunts.



Upgrading and Tiering Up
========================

Whenever dramatically appropriate, Dragon Blooded can pay 6xp to learn the Technique of a Martial Arts Style they know.

For each Tier, the Dragon Blooded has the following upgrades:
  * Increase Max Effort by 1
  * Add 1 Edge
  * Add 4 to her Pools (Mind, Body, Essence)
  * A Mundane Ability OR a Martial Arts Style OR a non-Caste Charm
  * A Caste Charm

When the five upgrades above are done, the Terrestrial tiers up and receives all the benefits of the next Tier of her Focus.
