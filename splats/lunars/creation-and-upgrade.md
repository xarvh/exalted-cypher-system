Character Creation
==================

Every Lunar starts with:

* 6 Essence
* +8 points to distribute between Body, Mind and Essence
* 1 Max Effort
* A Mundane Ability OR a Martial Arts Style
* 2 Charms, of which at least one form the Caste
* 2 Max Cyphers
* 3 Human or animal shapes in their Heart's Blood library

Lunar characters must also pick a Totem animal and a Tell.


Full Moon
---------
- Body 11 (Edge), Mind 7
- Trained in Combat OR Athletics


Changing Moon
-------------
- Body 9, Mind 9 (Edge in either)
- Trained in Presence OR Socialize OR Stealth


No Moon
-------
- Body 7, Mind 11 (Edge)
- Trained in Lore OR Occult


Upgrading and Tiering Up
========================

Whenever dramatically appropriate, Lunars can pay 4xp to learn the next Technique of a Martial Arts Style they know.

For each Tier, the Lunar has the following Upgrades:
  * Increase Max Effort by 1
  * Add 1 Edge
  * Add 5 to her Pools (Mind, Body, Essence)
  * A Mundane Ability OR a Martial Arts **Style**
  * A Caste Charm
  * A Caste or non-Caste Charm

When the six upgrades above are done, the Lunar tiers up and receives all the benefits of the next Tier of her Focus.


Shapeshifting
=============

Every Lunar can also Shapeshift as an Action.
During shapeshifting, the Lunar can Move as normally per the shape she is *leaving*.
The shifting is completed at the end of her Turn.

Adding a new form in the library requires a Sacred Hunt, and costs 1xp.
