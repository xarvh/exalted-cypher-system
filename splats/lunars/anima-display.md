Every 3 points of Essence spent by the Lunar in the same instant will raise the anima display up a notch.

Taking a Recovery action will lower the display by 2 notches.

A character can raise the display up to Burning Aura by spending 1 Essence.

1. **Dormant**
  The Lunarâ€™s anima is invisible to all senses, masking her Exalted nature.

2. **Caste Mark**
  The Caste Mark becomes clearly visible, shining through anything placed over it

  +1 Difficulty to Stealth

3. **Glowing Aura**
  The soul ignites, manifesting into an aura surrounding the character

  +2 Difficulty to Stealth

4. **Burning Aura**
  The character's anima blazes brightly, subsuming the Mark into its radiance.

  Wisps of bright power coil off his body and rise into the air.

  Anything subjected to his anima may become warm to the touch afterwards, or take on the faint scent of a summer afternoon.

  Stealth is impossible.

5. **Totemic Display**
  The anima explodes in a grand display of glory, specific to the character.

  This phantasmal display then collapses into a raging bonfire of spiritual power stretching high into the air, visible for miles.

  This level of display illuminates the area around the character out to short range, banishing shadows.
