# All Castes

## Tier 1


### Hybrid Body Transformation
`Essence 3, Enabler`

*The Lunar shifts into hybrid form, combining her human self and her spirit shape.*

Upon purchasing this Charm, her player chooses six dots of mutations reflecting her spirit shape.

While in her true human form, she may use this Charm to gain all the chosen mutations.

Additional 6 mutation points can be purchased for 1 XPs each.


### Many-Faced Moon Transformation
`Essence 3, Enabler`

*The Lunar wears ten thousand faces, yet she’s always herself.*

She alters her current form’s appearance: increasing or reducing her height by 25cm; increasing or decreasing her weight by up to 10%; altering her apparent age; changing or removing sexual characteristics; changing skin tone, eye color, and hair color and length; and/or cosmetic changes like adding scars or birthmarks.

She can alter both human and animal forms.

The Lunar can conceal her identity with this transformation but she can’t imitate specific individuals.
Changes made with this Charm are permanent.


## Tier 2


### Life of the Hummingbird
`Essence 5 (committed), Enabler`

After drinking fresh blood from a live human or animal the Lunar briefly borrows its skin; she temporarily takes on its shape as though she had its heart’s blood.

This Charm ends if she leaves that shape.


### Quicksilver Second Face
`Enabler`

*Reveling in protean grace, the Lunar dances between shapes.*

Shapeshifting becomes Enabler instead of Action.



# Changing Moon

- Use body language to convey a Presence roll, up to a sentence


## Tier 1


### Predator-and-Prey Mirror
`???`

*The Lunar adopts the bearing of predator or prey at her leisure.*

While using this Charm, she may freely shift between these two postures:

* Predator: Characters perceive the Lunar as their natural predator — she seems an auditor to a corrupt bureaucrat, or a bandit to a humble farmer.

* Prey: The Lunar presents herself as timid, vulnerable, and valuable. Anyone unfamiliar with her perceives her as an easy mark until she proves otherwise.

  ----> Spending more, it can affect onlookers


### Mysterious Stranger Intimation
`???`

*The Lunar exudes enticing mystery and the allure of the unfamiliar, drawing curious stares and fascinated admirers.*

Makes people curious and fascinated with the Lunar


## Tier 2


### Perfect Symmetry
`Enabler`

*The Lunar’s posture and body language reflect unassailable self-assurance.*

The cost of applying Effort for Presence rolls is 1 per level, even if one of the pools is at zero.


### Seductive Moonlit Dream
`Mind 6, Action`

*The Lunar embodies passion, drawing eyes and weakening wills.*

* Allows ignoring the target sexual or romantic preferences when trying to seduce (Red Rule still applies)
* Distracts anyone looking
* Anyone capable of feeling attraction risks obsessing


### Terrifying Bestial Visage
`Enabler`

Every detail of the Lunar’s bearing radiates predatory menace.

Her Max Effort is doubled for the purpose of threaten, intimidate or instill fear.


## Tier 3


### Hunted Stag Majesty
`Enabler`

When the Lunar is ambushed, she can make an automatic attempt to seduce or threaten the attacker.
If the roll is successful, the attack automatically misses.


### Honeyed Lips Inquiry
`Mind 6, Action`

*Enthralled by the Lunar’s beauty, her paramours heedlessly reveal whatever she wishes to hear.*

She rolls Presence or Performance to seduce a single character.

If successful, each extra success lets her ask him a question that scene which he must answer completely and truthfully.

Pooled characters can resist each question by spending 5 points of Mind.


## Tier 4


### Wasp-and-Termite Dance
`Mind 3 (committed), Enabler`

*The Lunar fosters perfect understanding among comrades, wordlessly communicating with sign language, expressive dance-like motions, or pheromones.*

She and any number of willing characters within long range can communicate amongst themselves.

This transcends language barriers, but characters unfamiliar with each other may suffer penalties on initial communication until they’ve grown accustomed.

The Lunar may reflexively add or remove characters from this group.

Outsiders can only detect the communication if they’re specifically watching for it or have superhuman or magically enhanced senses.


### Moon Beckons Tide
`???`

The Lunar releases a sigh of dreamy silver anima, calling a willing paramour to her side.

???? She makes a special (Appearance + Presence) persuade roll with (Essence) automatic successes against a character with a Tie of love, lust, etc., toward her within (Essence x3) miles, convincing him to seek out the Lunar.

She can either specify a known character or reach out aimlessly, letting the Storyteller choose a qualifying character within range, if one exists.

Affected characters become aware of her general location and condition, adding Tier bonus dice on Athletics, Ride, Sail, and Survival rolls to reach her.

????? If no such characters are in range, she recoups this Charm’s Willpower cost.

With an Appearance 5 repurchase, the Lunar may describe a companion she would like to attract rather than choosing someone with a Tie toward her.

Her description can encompass physical details, skills or talents, particular Intimacies, and social class or profession — “a farmer who resents the Realm’s presence,” “a beautiful woman at least six feet tall,” “a master thief fluent in Flametongue,” etc. — but not supernatural ability, membership in particular groups, or other traits.

She can’t choose a specific character, and the Storyteller should veto descriptions so narrow they could only apply to one person.

If no such characters are in range, the Lunar has the option of calling the character who comes closest to matching her description instead of recouping Willpower.


## Tier 5


### Divine Terror Avatar
`Enabler`

*A monster born of nightmares, the Lunar strikes fear even into the hearts of the enemies of the gods.*

Characters with established Ties of fear toward her (or her current shape) as well as trivial opponents can’t attack or make threaten rolls against her.

The characters can’t voluntarily erode these Ties unless they successfully harm the Lunar or cause her to suffer a notable setback or defeat.

Influence rolls to weaken these Ties fail automatically unless supported by evidence of such a setback or defeat.


### Passion-Unbinding Bacchanalia
`Mind 8, Action`

*The teeming throng of humanity isn’t so far removed from the panicked stampede or the rutting herd as they might like to think.*

Inspiring fear causes mass panic to break out among affected characters.

The object of their terror can be the Lunar, but might be something else, depending on how she stunts.

Affected characters flee the object of their terror in a panicked mob, stopping only when they reach extreme long range from it.

Inspiring lust causes affected characters to engage other affected characters who consent in courtship rituals or physical intimacy, ignoring etiquette and social decorum.

Someone who can’t find a consenting partner instead engages in artistic or athletic displays to attract one.

Unlike fear, lust won’t cause characters to desist from urgently pressing activities they’re already engaged in, such as combat — instead, they’ll wait until that activity concludes before engaging in their affections.


## Tier 6


### All-Consuming Obsession
`Mind 10, Action`

*Those who’ve known the Lunar’s sweet succor can never find satisfaction in the arms of any other; their hearts belong to her forevermore.*

The target of this Charm must have an Intimacy of attraction of any kind towards the Lunar or one of her shapes.

The Charm takes the form of any social interaction between the target and the Lunar (in whatever shape is involved in the Intimacy).

Every day, the target rolls his Integrity against the Lunar's Presence or Performance: on a success, nothing happens; on a failure, the Storyteller chooses one of his Intimacies to erode by one step, beginning with Minor and working up.

When no other positive Intimacies are left, failures cause the original intimacy towards the Lunar to strengthen.

This Charm ends if the original Intimacy towards the Lunar is fully eroded, but the target cannot deliberately work towards eroding it.


### Soul-Scarring Monstrosity
`Mind 10, Action`

*The Lunar’s dreadful mien evokes unfathomable horror, the face of every monster her victim has ever imagined.
And then, when she’s gone, he sees that awful visage still, leering at him from high in the trees, from dark alleyways, in the faces of his wife and children.*

??? ---> Gradually reduce the target's Mind/Level until it's 0.

The victim’s paranoia centers around the Lunar, causing him to see her hiding in every shadow or wearing his friends’ and families’ faces.

Each time he fails a Willpower roll against the Derangement, the Storyteller chooses one of his positive Ties to erode by one step, beginning with Minor Ties and working up, as his ability to trust others is poisoned by his dread certainty that they could be just another disguise for the Lunar.




-------------------------------

The Charms below still need to be consolidated and cleaned up.




### Subtle Silver Declaration
    The Lunar conceals the marks of her divinity to better
    walk among humanity. While at dim anima, her Tell
    (p. 133) is perfectly concealed from characters who’ve
    never seen it before. Even magic can’t pierce this
    concealment, excepting Eye of the Unconquered Sun
    and comparable effects. Characters who’ve seen the
    Lunar’s Tell before can still roll to detect it, but their 1s
    subtract successes.
    At glowing anima, the Lunar’s Tell isn’t automatically
    revealed, instead requiring a roll to detect. If a charac-
    ter hasn’t seen the Lunar’s Tell, 1s subtract successes
    from his roll.
    ----> Also reduce Stealth penalties for anima flare?


### Essential Mirror Nature
    The Lunar vanishes into the halls of the Scarlet Dynasty
    and the demon-ridden bowels of Hell with equal ease.
    Her Caste Mark and anima banner take on an appear-
    ance suitable to a different type of Exalt, though she
    can’t mimic effects like a Dragon-Blood’s anima flux.
    Her anima banner doesn’t reveal her Tell or moonsil-
    ver tattoos (p. 134) while disguised. Her iconic anima
    still displays her personalized imagery, but assumes an
    appearance suiting the type of Exalt she’s mimicking.
    Alternatively, the Lunar can manifest supernatural
    sensory displays, such as seeming to hover inches
    above the ground or smelling of sulfur, instead of mim-
    icking another type of Exalt. Appropriately chosen dis-
    plays add (Essence) non-Charm successes on rolls to
    disguise herself as a spirit, fae, or similar supernatural
    being.
    Magic like Burning Eye of the Deliverer (Exalted, p.
    358) that automatically sees through magical dis-
    guises can’t contest this Charm, save for Eye of the
    Unconquered Sun.

### Moon’s Hidden Face
    The Lunar wears her humanity like a cloak over her
    ever-shifting divine monstrosity. One or more of her
    mutations gain the Subtlety Merit (Exalted, p. 166).
    She may optionally disguise a concealed feature as a
    garment or accessory while not in use, e.g., disguising
    Unusual Hide as a fur cloak.


### Changing Plumage Mastery
    Faceless Trickster Approach: The Lunar assumes
    a forgettable countenance, imposing a −2 penalty on
    Investigation rolls to ascertain her identity. Characters
    who haven’t met her personally but have seen her
    in passing can’t remember doing so, finding her
    unremarkable.

    Seven-Colored Silkworm Flourish: The Lunar alters
    the appearance of worn mundane clothing and acces-
    sories as a miscellaneous action, or reflexively when
    she shapeshifts. This usually requires no roll, though
    assuming particularly lavish outfits or imitating be-
    spoke clothing might require an (Appearance + Craft)
    roll. The clothing reverts to its true form if removed.

    Stolen Scent Perfume: The Lunar can commit two
    motes to replace her body’s scent with that of any form
    she possesses. The substitution is perfect, as though
    she’d changed into that shape.

### Scent-of-All-Nations Attitude
    Though she travels many lands, the Lunar is never a
    stranger. Anyone who encounters her assumes that she’s
    a fellow member of his polity or ethnicity, inferring sig-
    nificance in subtle aspects of her bearing and overlooking
    differences in appearance, dress, language, or mannerisms
    that contradict this impression. She may thus benefit from
    positive Ties others have toward members of their own
    culture and evade negative Ties rooted in xenophobia. If a
    character’s successful read intentions or profile character
    action against the Lunar reveals information that contra-
    dicts this belief, he realizes that his first impression was
    mistaken, although not that she magically deceived him.


### One of the Herd
    ---> Add Faceless Trickster Approach?
    Subtly mimicking those around her, the Lunar van-
    ishes into bustling crowds or herds of animals. While
    she’s within short range of a group of four or more
    characters — a mercenary company, a Dynastic estate’s
    household servants, a wolf pack — and behaves like
    other members of the group, observers can’t distin-
    guish her from other group members unless they per-
    ceive her Tell. This Charm ends if she takes an overt
    action, including Joining Battle or blatantly displaying
    supernatural power.

### Subtle Chameleon Practice
    The Lunar becomes a living mirror of her surround-
    ings, shifting her skin’s color and texture to blend
    in. She adds (Appearance) dice on Stealth rolls and
    doesn’t need hiding places to enter concealment. Any
    situational dice her surroundings add on Stealth rolls
    become non-Charm successes.
    Attacking or moving to a different range band sup-
    presses this Charm’s benefits until the end of the next
    turn in which the Lunar doesn’t attack or change range
    bands. This Charm ends if the Lunar is hit by an attack.


### Fickle Lady’s Shifting Star
    Clothing herself in soul-deep lies, the Lunar outwits the
    eyes of prophets. While using Essential Mirror Nature,
    divination, magical scrying, and similar effects can’t
    provide information that contradicts her disguise, giving
    false results where necessary. A Sidereal who divines her
    future can’t predict events that betray her true identity; a
    city father’s Charms identify her as a resident of his city
    if she’s disguised as such; an enchanted gateway that re-
    jects all but its maker will open to her if she’s disguised as
    him. Such effects still provide accurate information to the
    extent they can do so without contradicting the Lunar’s
    disguise. Magic that enhances mundane efforts to contest
    disguises is unimpeded by this Charm.


### Clover Can’t Be Found
    Max Effort / Level don't count against stealth or disguise?


### Wolf Devours Shepherd
``
*Chaos breaks across the battlefield as the Lunar comes into view.*
    ---> Must be social in nature!
    ---> Allows attacking a commander?
    --> Accumulates maluses on an enemy commander that can see the Lunar


### Silver-Maned Warlord Glory
    Shining like a blood moon over the battlefield, the
    unstoppable Lunar general emanates an almost over-
    whelming spiritual pressure.
    ---> Expend anima to rally troops?

### Argent Songbird Voice
    Ignore crowd size
    reduce effort cost

### Arrogant Lion Bearing
    *The Lunar exudes force of personality, acknowledging no superior.*
    Use Presence for Social Defense?


### Guiding the Flock
    The herd of mortal society is at times predictable. The
    Lunar doubles 9s on a persuade, bargain, or threaten
    roll to convince her targets to act in a way that aligns
    with a custom of a culture they belong to.


### Shining Moon-Child Mark
    The Lunar lays a sacred brand upon another, proclaim-
    ing his place in her heart to all who see it. She can use
    this Charm after visibly marking someone she has a Tie
    toward — e.g., applying war paint or a tattoo, placing a
    ceremonial diadem on his brow, inflicting a crippling
    injury, etc. All who see the mark recognize that it was
    left by a powerful supernatural force and are aware of
    the emotional context of the Lunar’s Tie toward the
    marked character. Anyone who sees the mark and has
    Resolve lower than the Lunar’s Charisma is treated as
    having a Minor Tie toward the marked character with
    an emotional context either identical to the Lunar’s or
    otherwise appropriate: shunning someone who’s pro-
    voked a monster’s wrath, placating a divinity’s trusted
    envoy, etc. This Charm ends if the Lunar loses her Tie
    or the mark is removed.

### Lightning-Calling Challenge
    Spouting unforgivable insults or baseless slander,
    the Lunar makes herself the irresistible object of her
    enemy’s ire.
    [..] against one character to
    inspire him with rage toward her. An affected charac-
    ter can’t attack anyone but the Lunar that scene. This
    extends to any hostile effect, even those not modeled
    as attacks. Area-of-effect attacks can include other
    characters as long as they also include the Lunar.
    If the victim’s Resolve is beaten but he spends
    Willpower to resist, he still takes a −2 penalty on attack
    rolls against anyone but the Lunar that scene. Both the
    influence and penalty end if the Lunar is incapacitated,
    withdraws, or otherwise leaves combat.


### Creation-Spanning Passion
    The Lunar forges emotional bonds that transcend all
    limits and boundaries. She rolls to instill a Tie toward
    herself in someone she has a Tie toward, the emotional
    context of which matches or reciprocates her own Tie,
    adding (Intimacy) bonus dice. If she’s strengthening
    an already-existing Intimacy, she doesn’t need another
    supporting Intimacy as long as her Tie’s intensity
    equals or exceeds the level she’s raising the target’s to.
    While the Lunar and her target each have these Ties
    at Major or Defining intensity, they glimpse each other
    in dreams. When they sleep, each player may ask the
    Storyteller a question about the location, condition, or
    emotional state of the other player’s character. Players
    can conceal this information, requiring a successful
    read intentions roll from the other player to learn it.
    These dreams cease if the Lunar and the target go more
    than a month without interacting in the waking world.

### Lion’s Voice Command / Silver Thunder Roar
    The Lunar’s vocal cords shift to amplify her voice, her
    words rolling forth like thunder. She renders a spoken
    threaten or inspire roll, or ten seconds of regular speech,
    audible out to (Essence + Charisma) range bands. She
    ignores distance-based and environmental penalties,
    and can be heard over even the loudest noises.
    Once the Lunar has used this Charm, she waives the
    Willpower cost of subsequent activations for the scene.

    The Lunar’s ferocity tests the will of even the most
    courageous. She adds (higher of Essence or 3) dice
    on a threaten roll or on an inspire roll to create fear.
    Her targets can’t use Intimacies expressing courage
    or fearlessness to bolster Resolve against the roll or to
    resist it in a Decision Point.

    Filling her lungs with thunder, the Lunar roars loud
    enough to shake the heavens. To use this Charm, she
    must have Initiative 10+. She makes a decisive attack
    with ([Charisma or Strength] + [Athletics, Performance,
    or Presence]) against an enemy within long range,
    which can only be blocked or dodged with magic. An
    enemy hit by the attack is knocked back one range band,
    plus an additional range band for every three successes
    on the damage roll, to a maximum of long range from
    the Lunar, and lands prone. If an impact with a solid
    surface prevents her victim from being flung this full
    distance, he suffers falling damage (Exalted, p. 232) as
    though he’d fallen a number of range bands equal to
    the distance prevented by the impact. This damage is
    usually bashing, though some surfaces may inflict lethal
    damage.




### Unceasing Hunger Affliction
    Eyes flashing with mischievous foxfire, the Lunar
    incites dangerous obsessions. She rolls (Charisma +
    [Performance or Presence]) against one character to
    inspire fascination for a particular good or service —
    Varangian cuisine, a certain tailor’s clothing, a merce-
    nary company’s work, etc. Success inflicts the Obsession

    Derangement (Exalted, p. 169) at Minor intensity, fixat-
    ed on that good or service. Her victim suffers −1 Resolve
    against bargain rolls offering it to him, in addition to the
    Derangement’s Resolve penalty. The Derangement fades
    after (6 − target’s Integrity) days, but this duration resets
    if he fails a Willpower roll against the Derangement.

    With a Charisma 5, Essence 3 repurchase, the Lunar
    can pay a one-Willpower surcharge to make the
    Derangement contagious. When an affected character
    talks with others or enjoys the object of his obsession,
    he involuntarily makes a special ([Appearance or
    Charisma] + [Performance, Presence, or Socialize])
    inspire roll against all who hear or see him, slipping
    his obsession into conversation or radiating delight as
    he enjoys it. The victim isn’t aware of his influence,
    although his player can enhance it with Charms.
    Affected characters gain the Obsession Derangement,
    as above, although it isn’t contagious for them.

### Captivating Siren Voice / Argent Anglerfish Lure
    The Lunar’s voice draws all eyes to her, exerting an over-
    whelming gravity. She makes a special ([Appearance or
    Charisma] + [Performance or Presence]) inspire roll against
    all characters who hear her. As long as she continues to
    speak or sing, taking no nonreflexive actions, affected
    characters are compelled to approach as close as possible to
    her. This fascination can be exploited as though it were a
    Defining Intimacy. Characters will face risks equivalent to
    a serious task (Exalted, p. 216) to pursue her, but won’t take
    actions that would obviously physically harm them; if no
    safe path exists, they’ll stop and remain where they are. In
    combat, they must use their move action each turn to follow
    the Lunar, though they can still take other actions. This
    influence doesn’t prevent them from trying to harm her.
    --
    Such is the Lunar’s enthralling allure that fools will
    follow her through fire or march into the sea after
    her. When she uses Captivating Siren Voice, she may
    pay an eight-mote, two-anima surcharge to raise the
    cost to resist to three Willpower. Additionally, affected
    characters pursue her regardless of any perils faced in
    doing so — while they’re aware of the danger, the Lunar
    is so compelling they pay it little heed. They suffer a −3
    penalty on rolls against environmental hazards or traps
    encountered while pursuing the Lunar and on Join
    Battle rolls. If a character other than the Lunar attacks a
    victim of this effect, it counts as a surprise attack





# Full Moon


### Emerald Grasshopper Form (Full Moon, Tier 1)
``
*The Lunar compresses the fullness of her divinity into the humblest of forms.*

Allows the Lunar to take shapes smaller than a cat and larger than a fruit fly.



### Lessons of the Winter Wolf
``
*Under the Lunar’s instruction, young cubs untested in battle become grizzled warriors hungry for blood.*

---> Train troops. Should be something complementary to the Solars' Tiger Warrior Training Technique?


### Starving Beast Bloodthirst
``

---> Gives a temporary combat bonus to the troops, and makes them unrelenting?



### Wild Fury Awakening
``

*The Lunar beckons savage beasts and ferocious predators, rallying a terrifying horde from the wilderness.*

---> Summon mundane animals as a battle unit.

The Lunar rolls Presence or Survival to call a battle group made up of animals of a species whose heart’s blood she possesses from within (Tier) miles.

The battle group’s Size depends on the type of animal called.
Relatively weak animals, like squirrels, owls, or cats, form Size 3 battle groups; deadly predators and mighty beasts like tigers, yeddim, or bears form Size 2 battle groups; and super-predators like tyrant lizards and river dragons form Size 1 battle groups.

The Storyteller may deem that circumstances like the environment in which the Lunar uses this Charm raise or lower the battle group’s Size by one.

In combat, the battle group follows the Lunar’s order actions.
If she doesn’t guide it, it attacks the Lunar’s foes and follows her in pursuit of new enemies.
Commanding the animals to act outside of combat requires social influence.

This Charm can’t summon other characters’ familiars, magically enhanced animals, or animals with negative Major or Defining Ties to the Lunar.






### Finding the Needle’s Eye
``

-----> Facilitates an attack roll



### Many-Armed Warrior Panoply
``

*The Lunar is master of as many weapons as she has hands to wield them.*

---> Reduces cost of multiple attuned weapons?
---> What else?


### Needle Quill Technique
``

--->
The Lunar hardens a strand of hair into a barbed quill, plucks
a razor-sharp feather, or draws a similar projectile from her
body. This can be used as bow or crossbow ammunition, or
thrown as a dart (Exalted, p. 587). This Charm can’t provide
ammunition for firewands and other flame weapons.
A Dexterity 3 repurchase lets the Lunar pay a one-Ini-
tiative surcharge to reflexively reload a crossbow or
similar compatible weapon with the Slow tag. This lets
her use it with magic that creates multiple attacks, if
she reloads before each attack past the first.

Enhance with ONE of these effects:

- Bombardier Spittle Alchemy
  ----> Provides firedust analogues or explosives

- Stinging Ichneumon Scourge
  The Lunar’s living projectiles transform, growing
  flesh-impaling hooks or flying in pursuit of their quar-
  ry. When she attacks with Needle Quill Technique, her
  projectile continues to bedevil her enemy, preventing
  his onslaught penalty from falling below −1. This lasts
  (Essence) rounds for withering attacks, or one scene
  for decisive attacks. The target or an ally at close
  range can tear out or strike away the projectile with
  a difficulty 2 gambit, rolled against Defense (Lunar’s
  Dexterity), ending this effect.

- Consumptive Worm Hungers
  The Lunar’s quills twist within the wounds they inflict,
  growing spines or secreting corrosive acid. She may
  pay a three-mote surcharge on Stinging Ichneumon
  Scourge to inflict ongoing harm. On withering attacks,
  the victim loses Initiative (which the Lunar doesn’t
  gain) equal to the damage roll’s 9s and 10s at the start
  of each of his turns. On decisive attacks, he suffers
  one die of lethal decisive damage, ignoring Hardness,
  at the start of each of his turns. The difficulty of the
  gambit to remove the projectiles increases by +2. This
  ends when Stinging Ichneumon Scourge’s effect does.



### Twin Fangs Strike
`Body 6, Enabler`

*As the Lunar forces an opening, her allies hasten to strike.*

On a successful attack, an ally of the Lunar gets an extra attack on the same target, but he does not benefit from Edges.



### Octopus-and-Spider Barrage
``

*The Lunar’s limbs fly with superhuman speed, raining down blows on those who oppose her.*

She makes up to (Essence + 1) decisive attacks, maximum five, against one or more enemies.
She doesn’t need to use the same Ability for all attacks, and may reflexively change weapons between attacks.
Her Initiative is divided evenly among all attacks, rounded up, and doesn’t reset until the final attack is completed, assuming at least one hit.
She doesn’t lose Initiative for missed attacks unless all of them miss.
Protean: In shapes with more than four limbs, each successful attack adds one die to the damage of all subsequent attacks.
The bonus from multiple successful attacks stacks.


### Unhesitant Scorpion Lash (Tier 4)
``

----> Get a free attack on anyone who fails an action




### Bending Before the Storm
`Body 2, Enabler`

*The Lunar moves with the grace that only a shapechanger could achieve, shifting her form and stance to close gaps in her defense.*

Allows to spend Effort for Parry or Dodge rolls *after* the die has been rolled.

Allows to spend one level of Effort to ignore all penalties to Parry or Dodge rolls, including those due to being clinched, restrained, crippled.



### Coiled Serpent Strikes
``

*The Lunar answers her foe’s provocation with unthinking speed.*

---> She gets a counterattack whenever an attack misses her




### Ever-Evolving Defense
`Enabler`

*Dancing between myriad shapes, the Lunar is too unpredictable to be caught.*

----> Shapeshifting before an attack in a shape she hasn't used in the current Scene, allows her to use her full Max Effort for Parry or Dodge fore free.


### Foe-Baiting Sidestep
`Enabler`

On a successful Parry or Dodge, force the attacker to either switch places with the Lunar, or stumble forward a Short range.

If this causes the attacker to smack into a wall or fall into a precipice, he will still be allowed a roll to avoid or mitigate the consequences, but with a penalty equal to the attack roll failure.



### Flowing Body Evasion
``

----> More or less a perfect Dodge

In the instant she’s struck, the Lunar’s body becomes
fluid and malleable. Blades and arrows move through her
flesh without harming it; the tiniest gaps in an avalanche
let her fluid form pass; she even seeps through acid and
lava unharmed. She can apply Evasion against undodge-
able attacks (but not ambushes), or else gain +1 Evasion.
Once per scene, if an attack beats her Evasion, she may
pay one Willpower to subtract (her Evasion against the
attack) successes from the damage roll. If she takes no
damage from a non-gambit attack, she’s considered
to have dodged it. This effect can be reset by success-
fully dodging three decisive attacks from nontrivial
opponents.
Alternatively, she may use this Charm, paying its
Willpower surcharge, to perfectly dodge a source
of uncountable damage, rendering her immune to a
recurring source of uncountable damage for a scene.
This doesn’t require this Charm to be reset.



### Heron Sheds Rain
``

----> More or less a perfect Parry

In an instant of supreme speed, the Lunar’s guard approach-
es infinity. She can apply Parry against unblockable attacks
(but not ambushes). For a two-mote, one-Willpower sur-
charge, she rolls Initiative, adding successes to her Parry
as a non-Charm bonus. This resets her to base Initiative.
If she uses this Charm with Coiled Serpent Strikes, her
Initiative doesn’t reset until after the counterattack.
Alternatively, she can use this Charm, paying its
surcharge, to perfectly parry a source of uncountable
damage without resetting Initiative, rendering her
immune to a recurring source of uncountable damage
for a scene. She might use her claws to carve out a
shelter in which to weather an avalanche, or turn aside
a hurricane’s winds with a sword-stroke.
This Charm can only be used once per scene, unless
reset by gaining 20+ Initiative in an instant.






















# No Moon


### Boundary-Marking Meditation (No Moon, Tier 2)
`Destiny 1, Extended Action`
*Laying her mark upon the world, the Lunar claims a land as hers.*

She claims a single contiguous region no more than (Tier x 10) square miles as her territory.
To do so, she must fully master the land she wishes to claim.
She must physically traverse the majority of the region.
Any mortal communities living in the territory must accept her presence — they need not make her their leader, but must acknowledge her presence and that they lack the ability or desire to force her out.
Finally, if any supernatural beings — such as spirits or fellow Exalted — occupy the region and don’t consent to her claiming it, the Lunar must force them to submit by defeating them in combat or a similar challenge.
Land already claimed by another Lunar’s Boundary-Marking Meditation can’t be taken from him unless he voluntarily relinquishes it or dies.

While inside the territory, the Lunar will automatically know when foreigners will enter it, she won't know their identity, but she will know their approximate location.
If she so desires, the intruders will instinctively know that they are in someone's territory.

A Lunar can’t have more than (Tier) territories.
Her control of a territory ends if she voluntarily revokes it, or upon her death.

The territory can be immediately enhanced with one the following effects, and additional effects can be added for 1 Destiny point each:

- Ideal Argent Abode
  The Lunar’s player chooses three qualities that describe it, e.g. fertile, shadowy, and dense for a thick forest, or open, windy, and guarded for a steppe village.
  When a character within the territory takes an action that’s supported by any of these qualities, like foraging in a fertile woodland, he gets a +1.
  When a character takes an action opposed by a quality, like a general enacting a Strategic Maneuver roll to march a large army through the dense forest, each such quality imposes a −1 penalty.
  The Lunar never suffers these penalties.
  She can reflexively render a character she perceives immune to her territory’s penalties, or deny him its benefits.

  Story events may cause a territory to lose qualities — if the forest burns down, it’s no longer shadowy or dense.
  Once per story, the Lunar may change a territory’s qualities, replacing lost qualities and potentially swapping existing qualities for new ones as fits the story.

- Moon-and-Earth Blessing
  *The blessed region’s flora and fauna grow more abundant, and even the most barren climes become capable of sustaining life.*
  Rolls to forage, find shelter, navigate wilderness, or endure mundane environmental hazards within the region gain +2.
  The land is occasionally marked with uncanny strangeness: flowers blooming only at night, will-o’-the-wisps haunting the edges of gardens, owls flocking in greater number than other birds, etc.

- King-of-Beasts Sovereignty
  *The Lunar forges a bond between all animals of a single species and the mortal inhabitants.*
  All animals of that species form a Tie of loyalty toward the region’s mortal inhabitants.
  So long as they’re treated respectfully, they’ll offer protection, labor, and companionship to humans.

- Naming The World
  *Marking her land with sacred stones and signs, the Lunar fastens her dominion.*
  ---> Protect the dominion from the effects of the Wyld.

- Omnipresent Monster’s Lair
  *The Lunar lurks everywhere and nowhere within her territory, a primal fear whispering into her prey’s souls.*
  ---> Automatically Intimidate/Threaten anyone she is aware of anywhere in the territory.


### Living World Embodiment (No Moon, Tier 5)
`Enabler`

*The Lunar is an avatar of her sacred lands. Her wounds are the land’s wounds; her vigor renews the world.*

Each territory claimed with Boundary-Marking Meditation gains a virtual Body Pool of 10.
Damage to the Lunar’s territory manifests as withered plants, barren soil, disease-ridden animals, etc.

---> The Lunar can use the Territory Body Pool as hers, and vice versa.
---> Damage to the territory results in loss of bonuses and possibly even maluses to the territory features and enhancements.
---> While inside the territory, the Lunar can use her Recovery rolls to heal the territory.

At the Storyteller’s discretion, this can also undo blights, infestations, or curses upon the land.
