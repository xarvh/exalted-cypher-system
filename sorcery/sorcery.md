Sorcery is divided into three circles of understanding and power.
In the Old Realm, these were called the Terrestrial Circle, the Celestial Circle, and the Solar Circle, for only the Solar Exalted could master the last.
Realm-trained sorcerers sometimes speak of these as the Emerald, Sapphire, and Adamant Circles, though the last is spoken of only in legends and rumors since the disappearance of the Sun's Chosen.

Sorcery is a mountaintop of enlightenment to which many paths lead.
Most sorcerers are guided along their path by an instructor, promising young talents receive instruction from master sorcerers of the Realm at the Heptagram Academy, while others are taught by demons, elementals, or stranger things yet.
A few sorcerers forge their own path, following contemplative or meditative disciplines that purify and enlighten the mind, mastering relics or domains of power, or seeking out lost libraries and ancient grimoires.
All paths demand effort, dedication, and the willingness to abandon old views and deeply-held beliefs.
Those who attain sorcerous enlightenment see the world through new eyes, gaining a deeper insight into the nature of all things.

The powers of sorcery are divided into spells and sorcerous workings.

A **spell** is a discrete power with a defined cost and effects.

**Sorcerous workings** are custom, one-off feats, requiring considerable time and effort to complete; their expansive scope often requires the GM and the sorcerer's player to work together in defining its precise effects.



# Spells

In mechanical terms, a Spell is an Extended Action with:
  * An **Interval** of **one Action**
  * A **Difficulty** of 0
  * A **Goal Number** determined by the Spell
  * No **Terminus**


## Countermagic
  TODO: distortion and undoing


## Control Spells
  TODO: free spell per Circle



# Sorcerous Workings

In mechanical terms, a Sorcerous Working is a Project with:
  * An **Interval** of **one week**
  * A **Difficulty** of **1** (can be increased by the Player to have more control on the outcome)
  * The **Goal Number** is determined by the Circle used and the ambitionof the Project
  * A base **Terminus** of 5, which can be increased depending on the means available

Sorcerous Workings cannot be undone, but they can be stopped before they are completed.
Noticing the encroaching effects of a sorcerous working over a region is a Difficulty 3 Occult roll, while discerning the exact effect of the working is difficulty 5.
Lower both difficulties by one for characters who are sorcerers themselves, and by an additional one for characters who witness the sorcerer or his subordinates performing the ritual actions needed to enact the working.

Once a sorcerous working has been successfully completed, the sorcerer must pay XPs to finalize it.


## Terrestrial Circle Workings
Workings of the Terrestrial Circle are generally rooted in transforming, enhancing, or weakening pre-existing elements of the natural world, rather than directly invoking supernatural forces.
When outright supernatural forces are invoked, their intervention is generally constrained or specialized in some significant way.
Emerald Circle workings are typically limited either in power or scope.
An Emerald Circle working might enchant all the fields of a village, but only with a minor blessing, something that would still be a marvel to the inhabitants of the village, but augments the natural properties of that area or protects it against a mundane threat or nuisance, rather than completely overwriting the nature of that region through magic.
Conversely, the most powerful workings of this circle are confined to the scope of a single chamber within a larger structure or the transformation of a single character.
As a general rule, any sorcerous feat the GM feels should be routine for a Dragon-Blooded or mortal sorcerer should fall under this circle.

Below are some examples:

**Goal Number 5** (cost: 1xp)
  * Create or bind magical entities capable of performing mundane, household chores, but not much else, in service to a person, organization, or structure.
  * Enchant a path to prevent travelers from becoming lost or lead them to a particular location.
  * Invite an unbound First Circle demon into Creation in a ritual that culminates at midnight.
  * Make permanent but smallscale geographical alterations, such as drawing up a freshwater spring or flattening a hill.
  * Ward a town or neighborhood-sized region against a particular type of mundane nuisance, such as forest fires, crop-eating pests, or rabid animals.

**Goal Number 10** (cost: 2xp)
  * Cross two different species of plant or animal to create a hybrid species with the best traits of both.
  * Grant mutations to oneself or a willing subject.
  * Instill a plant, animal, or object with human-level intelligence.
  * Ward a chamber against scrying, teleportation, or intrusion by a particular type of spirit.

**Goal Number 20** (cost: 4xp)
  * Bless a region to enhance its natural properties, causing a field to always deliver a bountiful harvest or a freshwater river to always run clean.
  * Create a completely new but mundane form of life, or breed a specimen of an existing species with a minor supernatural power that augments its strongest traits.
  * Place a curse on a small region in a way that diminishes, warps, or blights its mundane aspects such as flora, fauna, or natural resources, making it all but impossible to make a livelihood off the cursed land.
  * Create a rift between two realms of existence that allows communication, possession, or similar forms of limited interaction, but not actual transportation.


## Celestial Circle Workings
Workings of the Celestial Circle are miracles of outright supernatural power, either rewriting the laws of the natural world on a relatively large scale or instilling supernatural power into the mundane world.
They can have scope sufficient to place powerful blessings or curses upon an entire village or a particular neighborhood or feature of a city, and their power is either an overt manifestation of supernatural magic, or a dramatic and drastic change to the properties of the natural world.
As a general rule, this is the circle for sorcerous workings that the GM feels established Celestial sorcerers, as well as accomplished Solar sorcerers, should be capable of achieving without excessive effort, or that an exceptionally potent Dragon Blood or mortal might be capable of attaining with great dedication, skill, and risk.

Examples include:

**Goal Number 25** (cost: 1xp)
  * Create a sorcerous bond between two characters that allows them to mentally communicate at any distance, or bestow a similarly useful but limited supernatural blessing.
  * Create persistent illusions that haunt a structure or town-sized region.
  * Invite an unbound Second Circle demon into Creation in a ritual that culminates on the night of the new moon.
  * Transform a chamber so that its interior emulates the environment of any natural terrain within Creation.
  * Ward a chamber or structure against all intruders with magical traps or barriers.

**Goal Number 30** (cost: 2xp)
  * Alter the weather of a town-sized region over a long duration, extending the harvest season by a month every year or making every winter exceptionally harsh.
  * Enchant fortifications to strengthen them against mundane assault or give them a measure of resilience to supernatural powers.
  * Grant a supernatural power to one's self or to a willing subject, such as a burning gaze, a hypnotic tongue, or cursed blood that turns into deadly scorpions when shed.
  * Make alterations to the nature of a willing supernatural being, such as imbuing a fire elemental with the aspect of earth to turn it into a being of molten magma, or reshaping a demon to express a different facet of its oversoul and altering its Charms to match.
  * Spread mutations throughout the mundane flora and fauna of an entire ecosystem.

**Goal Number 35** (cost: 4xp)
  * Create a loyal minion with supernatural powers comparable to a Second Circle demon or notable god.
  * Enchant the architecture of an entire structure to grant it limited mobility, the capacity to rearrange its internal structure, intelligence comparable to a human, or similar powers.
  * Open a permanent portal between two different realms of existence, such as a small shadowland or a faerie ring that leads travelers into the deep Wyld.


## Solar Circle Workings
  * Solar Circle workings are the height of what can be accomplished by sorcery.
  * They can rewrite the laws of reality, or write new ones into being.
  * Their scale can be huge, encompassing entire cities at the low end of their Goal Number or the whole of the cosmos at its upper, nigh-unattainable end.
  * Its power can bend time, space, or the boundaries of worlds to the sorcerer's will, and manipulate the fine workings of Essence down to the level of changing a being's very soul.
  * As long as the GM feels that something should be possible through a sorcerous working, it can be attained through workings of the Adamant Circle.

Examples include:

**Goal Number 40** (cost: 1xp)
  * Completely transform the terrain of a region to raise lush tropical paradises out of deserts, curse forests to wither away into scrubland, dry up seas, and so on.
  * Enchant a village or small city-sized region to emulate the nature of another realm of existence, possibly acting as a point of meeting between the two worlds.
  * Purify a hundred miles of shadowland or Wyld zone.
  * Extract the soul of a willing mortal from his body and transfer it into a new vessel, such as an automaton, manse, or similar form.
  * Restore someone's body to the prime of its youth.
  * Ward an entire city against invasion with supernatural traps, barriers, or concealment.

**Goal Number 50** (cost: 2xp)
  * Alter major metaphysical properties of a city-sized region: make it capable of moving across Creation, cause it to rise up and float in the sky, alter the nature of space within it so that it's bigger on the inside of its borders than the outside, meddle with the flow of time within it, make it invisible or intangible to those who do not meet certain conditions.
  * Enchant a city-sized region or a group to change the nature of the afterlife for those who die within it, such as designating particulars of how they reincarnate or transforming the souls of the dead into elementals.
  * Lay a potent curse on a city, region, or group of people that can only be broken when specific circumstances are met.
  * Utterly transform the nature of a supernatural being, remaking a demon as a god, or turning an elemental into a specter composed of the corpse-elements of the Underworld, or similar.

**Goal Number 75** (cost: 4xp)
  * Make subtle alterations to the metaphysics of the entire cosmos.
  * Create a supernatural being of a singular nature and considerable power.
  * Cast a city-sized region into a different realm of existence, or outside of time and space altogether, with set conditions for when it returns or how it can be accessed.


## Means
The Means of a sorcerous working are the resources that a sorcerer has available to put to use beyond the baseline of her own sorcerous power.
Means can take many forms, but all of them have the same benefit: adding to the Working's Terminus.
Multiple Means stack their benefit, and it is intended that more ambitious workings will require the extra rolls from these to succeed.
A sorcerous working with no means has a Terminus of 5 rolls.

Common Means include:

**Complementary Abilities** - A sorcerer who's mastered a Mundane Ability that naturally lends itself to the sorcerous working she's undertaking may claim that as one of her Means, allowing her to make one additional roll. Examples include using Medicine for a sorcerous working intended to create a new form of organism, or Performance for a working to fill the air around her home with songs which befuddle those who approach uninvited.
In order to claim this benefit, the sorcerer must be at least Specialized in the complementary Mundane Ability.
At the GM discretion, a sorcerer who's invested in a significant number of Charms or other supernatural powers that are either based on or enhance the complementary Mundane Ability may instead receive an additional two intervals from that Mundane Ability.

**Complementary Spells** - A sorcerer may claim one of her known spells as a Means if its function is related to the working she is trying to perform, allowing her to make one additional roll.
A sorcerer attempting to breed a species of obsidian butterflies would obviously benefit from knowing Death of Obsidian Butterflies, while one attempting to create a rift through which demons can possess mortal cultists could claim benefits from knowing the spell to summon demons of the same circle as those brought through the rift.

**Cooperation** - The assistance of another sorcerer initiated into the Circle of the working allows for one additional roll.
Alternatively, the sorcerer could receive assistance from a supernatural entity who, while not a sorcerer, possesses powers that naturally lend themselves to the completion of the working: a sorcerer trying to revive a dry riverbed might seek the assistance of a river god or water elemental, while one attempting to open a portal into the Underworld might seek help from an necromancer.
As a third alternative, a character might use a group of characters who are not sorcerers, but are well-versed in Occult, such as an infernal cult or a Heptagram class.
Each of these alternatives can add one roll, but they don't stack with each other.
In theory, a sorcerer who had access to a large organization of fellow sorcerers initiated into the Circle of the working could add two additional rolls from this Means, but such organized networks are few and far between in the current, fallen era.

**Extra Time** - A sorcerer willing to invest months or even years of preparation, research, and diligent practice into a sorcerous working may claim that extra time as one of her Means.
Extending the Interval of the roll from one week to one month allows the sorcerer to make one additional roll, while extending the interval to one cycle (three months) allows for two additional rolls.
A sorcerer could receive three additional rolls by extending the interval to one year, but only the most dedicated of sorcerers are willing to retire from the world for that long.

**Exotic Components** - Esoteric or rare materials that the sorcerer has accumulated over the course of the story may be consumed in the process of a working to count as a Means, allowing the sorcerer to make one additional roll.
What counts for this category is left largely to the GM discretion, as he will generally be the one introducing these exotic components into the game.
The severed head of a Wyld behemoth, carved with glyphs of abjuration and displayed prominently from the walls of a city, might aid in warding that city against the influence of the Wyld, while an orichalcum lantern lit with a tongue of sunfire found in a First Age ruin could be used as part of a working to purify a shadowland.
At the GM discretion, exceptionally rare or powerful components, such as the withered corpus-fragments of a slain Deathlord, can add two additional rolls to an appropriate working.

**Sorcerous Infrastructure** - Sorcerous laboratories or ritual chambers stocked with esoteric texts, occult reagents, and other tools of the sorcerer’s trade add one additional roll to a sorcerous working.
It is no easy thing to assemble such infrastructure—even among the opulence of the Realm, most sorcerers must make do with basic, rudimentary study chambers tucked away in the far wing of a family manse.
For a newly-Exalted sorcerer to assemble her own sorcerous infrastructure would be an adventure in itself.
Sorcerous infrastructure from the First Age could provide two additional rolls to a working, if repaired and restored to full functionality.
