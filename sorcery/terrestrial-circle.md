## Death of Obsidian Butterflies
Shaping: 5
Duration: Instant

Sculpting Essence into volant black glass, the sorcerer unleashes a cascade of obsidian butterflies.

She rolls Occult as an undodgeable attack applied in a line against enemies out to medium range.

This line is wide enough to strike all opponents within the width of a single range band and reaches high enough to strike aerial enemies who are at short range to the ground (medium range enemies in the air can still be targeted by directing the butterflies to fly along an upward path, rather than a horizontal one).

Battle groups are especially vulnerable to being cut down by this spell, taking a -2 penalty to Defense against it.

The attack deals raw damage equal to the sorcerer’s (Tier + extra successes) against a battle group.

Scenery made of wood, glass, or other fragile materials is generally destroyed.

After this spell has been cast, the obsidian butterflies fall to the ground and shatter, creating terrain that may be hazardous for barefooted characters to traverse

Any character wearing armored boots can generally ignore the debris.

A sorcerer who knows Death of Obsidian Butterflies as her control spell gains (Tier) bonus dice to the spell’s attack roll.

When her emotions run hot, butterfly silhouettes rise from her shadow.

When she is angry, her fingernails turn to sharp volcanic glass, making it possible to cut cloth or paper, rend wood or flesh and other similar stunts.

## Stormwind Rider
Shaping: 5
Duration: One hour

Bending the winds to her will, the sorcerer creates a servile dust devil to ride.
The Stormwind Rider is treated as a flying mount, although it cannot take the sorcerer to more than short range above the ground.
The whirlwind can carry up to Tier additional characters, or one hundred pounds of cargo in place of a single passenger.
While it cannot soar as high as the Cirrus Skiff, the Stormwind Rider can travel at nearly 100 km/h and maneuver through forests or cities.

A sorcerer who knows Stormwind Rider as her control spell is buffeted by winds whenever she is beset by strong emotions.
Sudden movements cause a small vortex powerful enough to scatter papers, upset furniture and topple someone caught off-guard.
Her vertical leaps are buoyed by wind, allowing her to leap high upward.

Once this spell’s duration has elapsed, the sorcerer may spend 3 Essence to extend its duration for another hour.
She may do so for as long as she has Essence to continue using this power.
